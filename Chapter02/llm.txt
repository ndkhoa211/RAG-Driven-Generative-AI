Space explorationis the physical investigation ofouter spacebyuncrewed robotic space probesand throughhuman spaceflight. While the observation of objects in space, known asastronomy, predates reliablerecorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficientrocketsduring the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. The early era of space exploration was driven by a "Space Race" in which theSoviet Unionand theUnited Statesvied to demonstrate their technological superiority. Landmarks of this era include the launch of the first human-made object to orbitEarth, the Soviet Union'sSputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the firstMoon landingby the AmericanApollo 11mission on 20 July 1969. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the firsthuman spaceflight(Yuri GagarinaboardVostok 1) in 1961, the firstspacewalk(byAlexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, thefirst automatic landingon another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the firstspace station(Salyut 1) in 1971. In the 1970s, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as theSpace Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation, the foremost example being theInternational Space Station(ISS), built between 1998 and 2011. The 2000s brought advancements in the national space-exploration programs ofChina, theEuropean Union,Japan, andIndia. The 2010s saw the rise of theprivate space industryin earnest with the development of private launch vehicles, space capsules, and satellite manufacturing. In the 2020s, the two primary global programs gaining traction are Moon-focused: the Chinese-ledInternational Lunar Research Stationand the U.S.-ledArtemis Program, with its plan to build theLunar Gatewayand theArtemis Base Camp, each with a set of international partners. The firsttelescopeis said to have been invented in 1608 in theNetherlandsby aneyeglassmaker namedHans Lippershey, but their first recorded use in astronomy was byGalileo Galileiin 1609.In 1668Isaac Newtonbuilthis ownreflecting telescope, the first fully functional telescope of this kind, and a landmark for future developments due to its superior features over the previousGalilean telescope. A string ofdiscoveries in the Solar System(and beyond) followed, then and in thenext centuries: themountains of the Moon, thephases of Venus,the main satellitesofJupiterandSaturn, therings of Saturn, manycomets, theasteroids, the new planetsUranusandNeptune, and many moresatellites. TheOrbiting Astronomical Observatory 2was the firstspace telescopelaunched 1968,but the launch of theHubble Space Telescopein 1990set a milestone. As of 1 December 2022, there were 5,284 confirmedexoplanetsdiscovered. TheMilky Wayis estimated to contain 100–400 billionstarsand more than 100 billionplanets.There are at least 2 trilliongalaxiesin theobservable universe.HD1is themost distantknown object from Earth, reported as 33.4 billionlight-yearsaway. MW 18014was a GermanV-2 rockettest launch that took place on 20 June 1944, at thePeenemünde Army Research CenterinPeenemünde. It was the first human-made object to reachouter space, attaining anapogeeof 176 kilometers,which is well above theKármán line.It was a vertical test launch. Although the rocket reached space, it did not reachorbital velocity, and therefore returned to Earth in an impact, becoming the firstsub-orbital spaceflight.In 1949, theBumper-WACreached an altitude of 393 kilometres (244 mi), becoming the first human-made object to enter space, according toNASA. The first successful orbital launch was of theSovietuncrewedSputnik 1("Satellite 1") mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed about 83 kg (183 lb), and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about 250 km (160 mi). It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40 MHz), which emitted "beeps" that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by ameteoroid.Sputnik 1was launched by anR-7rocket. It burned up upon re-entry on 3 January 1958. The first successful human spaceflight wasVostok 1("East 1"), carrying the 27-year-old Russiancosmonaut,Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advancedSoviet space programand it opened an entirely new era in space exploration:human spaceflight. The first artificial object to reach another celestial body wasLuna 2which reached theMoonin 1959.The firstsoft landingon another celestial body was performed byLuna 9landing on the Moon on 3 February 1966.Luna 10became the first artificial satellite of the Moon, entering in a lunar orbit on 3 April 1966. The first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed byApollo 11on 20 July 1969, landing on the Moon. There have been a total of six spacecraft with humanslanding on the Moonstarting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972. The first interplanetaryflybywas the 1961Venera 1flyby ofVenus, though the 1962Mariner 2was the first flyby ofVenusto return data (closest approach 34,773 kilometers).Pioneer 6was the first satellite to orbit theSun, launched on 16 December 1965. The other planets were first flown by in 1965 forMarsbyMariner 4, 1973 forJupiterbyPioneer 10, 1974 forMercurybyMariner 10, 1979 forSaturnbyPioneer 11, 1986 forUranusbyVoyager 2, 1989 forNeptunebyVoyager 2. In 2015, thedwarf planetsCeresandPlutowere orbited byDawnand passed byNew Horizons, respectively. This accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in theSolar System, theSun, theMoon, andCeresandPluto(two of the fiverecognized dwarf planets). The first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing ofVenera 7, which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes fromVenus. In 1975,Venera 9was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus. In 1971, theMars 3mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds. Later, much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation byViking 1from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus byVenera 13in 1982, the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission. Venus and Mars are the two planets outside of Earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewedrobotic spacecraft. Salyut 1was the firstspace stationof any kind, launched intolow Earth orbitby theSoviet Unionon 19 April 1971. TheInternational Space Station(ISS) is currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations, inhabited continuously since the year 2000. The other, Tiangong space station built by China, is now fully crewed and operational. Voyager 1became the first human-made object toleave the Solar Systemintointerstellar spaceon 25 August 2012. The probe passed theheliopauseat 121AUto enterinterstellar space. TheApollo 13flight passed thefar side of the Moonat an altitude of 254 kilometers (158 miles; 137 nautical miles) above the lunar surface, and 400,171 km (248,655 mi) from Earth, marking therecordfor the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth in 1970. As of 9 February 2025[update]Voyager 1was at a distance of 166.4 AU (24.89 billion km; 15.47 billion mi) from Earth.It is the most distant human-made object from Earth. Starting in the mid-20th century probes and then human missions were sent into Earth orbit, and then on to the Moon. Also, probes were sent throughout the known Solar System, and into Solar orbit. Uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury by the 21st century, and the most distance active spacecraft,Voyager 1and2traveled beyond 100 times the Earth-Sun distance. The instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the Sun's heliosphere, a sort of bubble of particles made in the Galaxy by the Sun'ssolar wind. TheSunis a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth's magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth's surface. The Sun generates mostspace weather, which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with theApollo Telescope Mount, have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective.Parker Solar Probe, launched in 2018, will approach the Sun to within 1/9th the orbit of Mercury. Mercuryremains the least explored of theTerrestrial planets. As of May 2013, theMariner 10andMESSENGERmissions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury.MESSENGERentered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 (Munsell, 2006b). A third mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in 2025,BepiColombois to include twoprobes. BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and theEuropean Space Agency.MESSENGERand BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10'sflybys. Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, ordelta-v. Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable. Venuswas the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first flyby was the 1961Venera 1, though the 1962Mariner 2was the first flyby to successfully return data. Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide agravitational assisten route to other celestial bodies. In 1967,Venera 4became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970,Venera 7became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975, with the Soviet orbiterVenera 9, some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus usingradarto pierce the obscuring atmosphere. Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference. For example, the existence of theVan Allen radiation beltswas unknown until their discovery by the United States' first artificial satellite,Explorer 1. These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical. Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space-based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, thehole in the ozone layerwas found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify. TheMoonwas the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans. In 1959, the Soviets obtained the first images of thefar side of the Moon, never previously visible to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with theRanger 4impactor in 1962. Starting in 1966, the Soviets successfully deployed a number oflandersto the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later,Surveyor 1marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in theLunokhod programin the early 1970s, which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfullybrought lunar soil samples to Earthfor study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth. Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters. China'sChang'e 4in 2019 andChang'e 6in 2024 achieved the world's first landing and sample return on thefar side of the Moon. India'sChandrayaan-3in 2023 achieved the world's first landing on thelunar south poleregion. Crewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with theApollo 8mission that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In 1969, theApollo 11mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long. TheApollo 17mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit.Artemis IIis scheduled to complete a crewed flyby of the Moon in 2025, andArtemis IIIwill perform the first lunar landing since Apollo 17 with it scheduled for launch no earlier than 2026. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously. The exploration ofMarshas been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan, and India. Dozens ofrobotic spacecraft, includingorbiters,landers, androvers, have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the Red Planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth. The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak ofThe Great Galactic Ghoulwhich subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This phenomenon is also informally known as the "Mars Curse".In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars,Indiahas become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt. India'sMars Orbiter Mission(MOM)is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of₹450Crore(US$73 million).The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates. Called theEmirates Mars Mission, it was launched on 19 July 2020 and went into orbit around Mars on 9 February 2021. The uncrewed exploratory probe was named "Hope Probe" and was sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail. The Russian space missionFobos-Grunt, which launched on 9 November 2011, experienced a failure leaving it stranded inlow Earth orbit.It was to begin exploration of thePhobosand Martian circumterrestrial orbit, and study whether the moons of Mars, or at least Phobos, could be a "trans-shipment point" for spaceships traveling to Mars. Until the advent ofspace travel, objects in theasteroid beltwere merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which wasGalileo, which flew past two:951 Gasprain 1991, followed by243 Idain 1993. Both of these lay near enough toGalileo's planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by theNEAR Shoemakerprobe in 2000, following an orbital survey of the object,433 Eros. The dwarf planetCeresand the asteroid4 Vesta, two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA'sDawnspacecraft, launched in 2007. Hayabusawas arobotic spacecraftdeveloped by theJapan Aerospace Exploration Agencytoreturn a sample of materialfrom the small near-Earth asteroid25143 Itokawato Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa,Hayabusastudied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010. The exploration ofJupiterhas consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973. A large majority of the missions have been "flybys", in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as inPioneerandVoyagerprograms. TheGalileoandJunospacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet's orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is precluded. Reaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2 km/s,which is comparable to the 9.7 km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.Fortunately,gravity assiststhroughplanetary flybyscan be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration. Jupiter has 95known moons, many of which have relatively little known information about them. Saturnhas been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission (Cassini–Huygens) planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions consist of flybys in 1979 byPioneer 11, in 1980 byVoyager 1, in 1982 byVoyager 2and an orbital mission by theCassinispacecraft, which lasted from 2004 until 2017. Saturn has at least 62known moons, although the exact number is debatable since Saturn's rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes. The largest of the moons isTitan, which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth. Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander, theHuygensprobe deployed by theCassinispacecraft. The exploration ofUranushas been entirely through theVoyager 2spacecraft, with no other visits currently planned. Given itsaxial tiltof 97.77°, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986.Voyager 2studied the planet's unique atmosphere andmagnetosphere.Voyager 2also examined itsring systemand themoons of Uranusincluding all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons. Images of Uranus proved to have a uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be unique, being profoundly affected by the planet's unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence thatMirandahad been unusually geologically active. The exploration of Neptune began with the 25 August 1989Voyager 2flyby, the sole visit to the system. The possibility of aNeptune Orbiterhas been discussed, but no other missions have been given serious thought. Although the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus duringVoyager 2's visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds,auroras, and even a conspicuousanticyclone storm systemrivaled in size only by Jupiter'sGreat Red Spot. Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as 2,100 km/h.Voyager 2also examinedNeptune's ringandmoon system. It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring "arcs" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune's three previously known moons,Voyager 2also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which,Proteus, proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data fromVoyager 2supported the view that Neptune's largest moon,Triton, is a capturedKuiper beltobject. Thedwarf planetPluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times) and small mass (making capture into orbit difficult at present).Voyager 1could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby.Voyager 2never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto. After an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbedNew Horizonswas granted funding from the United States government in 2003.New Horizonswas launched successfully on 19 January 2006. In early 2007 the craft made use of agravity assistfromJupiter. Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015; scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter. TheNew Horizonsmission also performed a flyby of the small planetesimalArrokoth, in theKuiper belt, in 2019. This was its first extended mission. Although many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries-worth of observations, only a few comets have been closely visited. In 1985, theInternational Cometary Explorerconducted the first comet fly-by (21P/Giacobini-Zinner) before joining theHalley Armadastudying the famous comet. TheDeep Impactprobesmashed into9P/Tempelto learn more about its structure and composition and theStardustmissionreturned samples of another comet's tail. ThePhilaelandersuccessfully landed onComet Churyumov–Gerasimenkoin 2014 as part of the broaderRosettamission. Deep space exploration is the branch ofastronomy,astronauticsandspace technologythat is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space.Physical exploration of space is conducted both byhuman spaceflights(deep-space astronautics) and byrobotic spacecraft. Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies includeanti-matter,nuclear powerandbeamed propulsion.Beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes. Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by theBreakthrough Initiativesto develop a proof-of-concept fleet oflight sailspacecraft namedStarChip,to be capable of making the journey to theAlpha Centauristar system 4.37light-yearsaway. It was founded in 2016 byYuri Milner,Stephen Hawking, andMark Zuckerberg. An article in the science magazineNaturesuggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars. In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, "a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit"; second, "extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars"; and finally, "developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin". Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure. The Artemis program is an ongoingcrewed spaceflight programcarried out byNASA, U.S.commercial spaceflight companies, and international partners such asESA,with the goal of landing "the first woman and the next man" on the Moon, specifically at thelunar south poleregion. Artemis would be the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans toMars. In 2017, the lunar campaign was authorized bySpace Policy Directive 1, using various ongoing spacecraft programs such asOrion, theLunar Gateway,Commercial Lunar Payload Services, and adding an undeveloped crewed lander. TheSpace Launch Systemwill serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion, while commercial launch vehicles are planned for use to launch other elements of the campaign.NASA requested $1.6 billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year 2020,while the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a five-year budget profilewhich is needed for evaluation and approval by the U.S.Congress.As of 2024, the first Artemis mission was launched in 2022 with the second mission, a crewed lunar flyby planned for 2025.Construction on the Lunar Gateway is underway with initial capabilities set for the 2025–2027 timeframe.The first CLPS lander landed in 2024, marking the first US spacecraft to land sinceApollo 17. The research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such asNASAandRoscosmos, is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such asNASA spin-offs), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program.It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions of dollars' worth of minerals and metals. Such expeditions could generate substantial revenue.In addition, it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering.Space exploration also gives scientists the ability to perform experiments in other settings and expand humanity's knowledge. Another claim is that space exploration is a necessity to humankind and that staying on Earth will eventually lead toextinction. Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic.Stephen Hawking, renowned British theoretical physicist, said, "I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars."AuthorArthur C. Clarke(1950) presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monographInterplanetary Flight.He argued that humanity's choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death. These motivations could be attributed to one of the first rocket scientists in NASA,Wernher von Braun, and his vision of humans moving beyond Earth. The basis of this plan was to: Develop multi-stage rockets capable of placing satellites, animals, and humans in space. Development of large, winged reusable spacecraft capable of carrying humans and equipment into Earth orbit in a way that made space access routine and cost-effective. Construction of a large, permanently occupied space station to be used as a platform both to observe Earth and from which to launch deep space expeditions. Launching the first human flights around the Moon, leading to the first landings of humans on the Moon, with the intent of exploring that body and establishing permanent lunar bases. Assembly and fueling of spaceships in Earth orbit for the purpose of sending humans to Mars with the intent of eventually colonizing that planet. Known as the Von Braun Paradigm, the plan was formulated to lead humans in the exploration of space. Von Braun's vision of human space exploration served as the model for efforts in space exploration well into the twenty-first century, with NASA incorporating this approach into the majority of their projects.The steps were followed out of order, as seen by the Apollo program reaching the moon before the space shuttle program was started, which in turn was used to complete the International Space Station. Von Braun's Paradigm formed NASA's drive for human exploration, in the hopes that humans discover the far reaches of the universe. NASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration. Overall, the U.S. public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration. According to anAssociated PressPoll conducted in July 2003, 71% of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is "a good investment", compared to 21% who did not. Space advocacyandspace policyregularly invokes exploration as ahuman nature. Spaceflightis the use ofspace technologyto achieve the flight ofspacecraftinto and through outer space. Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities likespace tourismandsatellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight includespace observatories,reconnaissance satellitesand otherEarth observation satellites. A spaceflight typically begins with arocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force ofgravityand propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study calledastrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate duringatmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact. Satellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites.Space stationsand humanspacecraftin orbit are also satellites. The commercialization of space first started out with the launching of private satellites by NASA or other space agencies. Current examples of the commercial satellite use of space includesatellite navigation systems, satellite television, satellite communications (such as internet services) andsatellite radio. The next step of commercialization of space was seen as human spaceflight. Flying humans safely to and from space had become routine to NASA and Russia.Reusable spacecraft were an entirely new engineering challenge, something only seen in novels and films like Star Trek and War of the Worlds. AstronautBuzz Aldrinsupported the use of making a reusable vehicle like the space shuttle. Aldrin held that reusable spacecraft were the key in making space travel affordable, stating that the use of "passenger space travel is a huge potential market big enough to justify the creation of reusable launch vehicles".Space tourismis a next step in the use of reusable vehicles in the commercialization of space. The purpose of this form ofspace travelis personal pleasure. Private spaceflight companiessuch asSpaceXandBlue Origin, andcommercial space stationssuch as the Axiom Space and theBigelow Commercial Space Stationhave changed the cost and overall landscape of space exploration, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future. Astrobiology is theinterdisciplinarystudy of life in the universe, combining aspects ofastronomy,biologyand geology.It is focused primarily on the study of theorigin, distribution andevolutionof life. It is also known asexobiology(from Greek: έξω,exo, "outside").The term "Xenobiology" has been used as well, but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means "biology of the foreigners".Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth.In the Solar System, some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan. To date, the longest human occupation of space is theInternational Space Stationwhich has been in continuous use for 24 years, 359 days.Valeri Polyakov's record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard theMirspace station has not been surpassed. The health effects of space have been well documented through years of research conducted in the field ofaerospace medicine. Analog environments similar to those experienced in space travel (like deep sea submarines), have been used in this research to further explore the relationship between isolation and extreme environments.It is imperative that the health of the crew be maintained as any deviation from baseline may compromise the integrity of the mission as well as the safety of the crew, hence the astronauts must endure rigorous medical screenings and tests prior to embarking on any missions. However, it does not take long for the environmental dynamics of spaceflight to commence its toll on the human body; for example,space motion sickness (SMS)– a condition which affects the neurovestibular system and culminates in mild to severe signs and symptoms such as vertigo, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and disorientation – plagues almost all space travelers within their first few days in orbit.Space travel can also have an impact on the psyche of the crew members as delineated in anecdotal writings composed after their retirement. Space travel can adversely affect the body's natural biological clock (circadian rhythm); sleep patterns causing sleep deprivation and fatigue; and social interaction; consequently, residing in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment for a prolonged amount of time can result in both mental and physical exhaustion.Long-term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune system suppression, problems with eyesight, and radiation exposure. The lack of gravity causes fluid to rise upward which can cause pressure to build up in the eye, resulting in vision problems; the loss of bone minerals and densities; cardiovascular deconditioning; and decreased endurance and muscle mass. Radiationis an insidious health hazard to space travelers as it is invisible and can cause cancer. When above the Earth's magnetic field, spacecraft are no longer protected from the sun's radiation; the danger of radiation is even more potent in deep space. The hazards of radiation can be ameliorated through protective shielding on the spacecraft, alerts, anddosimetry. Fortunately, with new and rapidly evolving technological advancements, those inMission Controlare able to monitor the health of theirastronautsmore closely usingtelemedicine. One may not be able to completely evade the physiological effects of space flight, but those effects can be mitigated. For example, medical systems aboard space vessels such as theInternational Space Station (ISS)are well equipped and designed to counteract the effects of lack of gravity and weightlessness; on-board treadmills can help prevent muscle loss and reduce the risk of developing prematureosteoporosis.Additionally, a crew medical officer is appointed for each ISS mission and aflight surgeonis available 24/7 via theISS Mission Control Centerlocated inHouston, Texas.Although the interactions are intended to take place in real time, communications between the space and terrestrial crew may become delayed – sometimes by as much as 20 minutes– as their distance from each other increases when the spacecraft moves further out of low Earth orbit; because of this the crew are trained and need to be prepared to respond to any medical emergencies that may arise on the vessel as the ground crew are hundreds of miles away. Many past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a "steppingstone" to the other planets, especially Mars. At the end of 2006, NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024. Beyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack ofprivate property, the inability or difficulty in establishingproperty rightsin space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent ofspace technologyin the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making ofnationalterritorial claimsinouter spaceand oncelestial bodieshas been specifically proscribed by theOuter Space Treaty, which had been, as of 2012[update], ratified by allspacefaring nations.Space colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) humanhabitationof locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as theMoonorMars, using significant amounts ofin-situ resource utilization. Participation and representation of humanity in space is an issue ever since the first phase of space exploration.Some rights of non-spacefaring countries have been mostly secured through internationalspace law, declaring space the "province of all mankind", understandingspaceflightas its resource, though sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized asimperialistand lacking.Additionally to international inclusion, the inclusion of women andpeople of colourhas also been lacking. To reach a more inclusive spaceflight, some organizations like theJustspace AllianceandIAUfeaturedInclusive Astronomyhave been formed in recent years. The first woman to go to space wasValentina Tereshkova. She flew in 1963 but it was not until the 1980s that another woman entered space again. All astronauts were required to be military test pilots at the time and women were not able to join this career. This is one reason for the delay in allowing women to join space crews.After the rule changed,Svetlana Savitskayabecame the second woman to go to space, she was also from theSoviet Union.Sally Ridebecame the next woman in space and the first woman to fly to space through the United States program. Since then, eleven other countries have allowed women astronauts. The first all-female space walk occurred in 2018, includingChristina KochandJessica Meir. They had both previously participated in space walks with NASA. The first woman to go to the Moon is planned for 2026. Despite these developments, women are underrepresented among astronauts and especially cosmonauts. Issues that block potential applicants from the programs, and limit the space missions they are able to go on, include: Artistry in and from space ranges from signals, capturing and arranging material likeYuri Gagarin'sselfiein space or the imageThe Blue Marble, over drawings like the first one in space by cosmonaut and artistAlexei Leonov, music videos likeChris Hadfield's cover of Space Oddityon board the ISS, to permanent installations on celestial bodies likeon the Moon.

TheApollo program, also known asProject Apollo, was the United Stateshuman spaceflightprogram led byNASA, whichlandedthe first humans on theMoonin 1969. Apollo was conceived duringProject Mercuryand executed afterProject Gemini. It was conceived in 1960 as a three-person spacecraft during the presidency ofDwight D. Eisenhower. Apollo was later dedicated to PresidentJohn F. Kennedy's national goal for the 1960s of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth" in an address to theU.S. Congresson May 25, 1961. Kennedy's goal was accomplished on theApollo 11mission, when astronautsNeil ArmstrongandBuzz Aldrinlanded theirApollo Lunar Module(LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, whileMichael Collinsremained inlunar orbitin thecommand and service module(CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landedastronautson the Moon, the last,Apollo 17, in December 1972. In these six spaceflights,twelve people walked on the Moon. Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It encountered a major setback in 1967 when theApollo 1cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first Moon landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunargeologicalandastrophysicalexploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved landings; but theApollo 13landing had to be aborted after an oxygen tank exploded en route to the Moon, crippling the CSM. The crew barely managed a safe return to Earth by using theLunar Moduleas a "lifeboat" on the return journey. Apollo used theSaturn family of rocketsas launch vehicles, which were also used for anApollo Applications Program, which consisted ofSkylab, aspace stationthat supported three crewed missions in 1973–1974, and theApollo–SoyuzTest Project, a jointUnited States-Soviet Unionlow Earth orbitmission in 1975. Apollo set several majorhuman spaceflight milestones. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyondlow Earth orbit.Apollo 8was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and Apollo 11 was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one. Overall, the Apollo program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability and funded construction of itsJohnson Space CenterandKennedy Space Center. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental torocketryand human spaceflight, includingavionics,telecommunications, andcomputers. The program was named after the Greek godApolloby NASA managerAbe Silverstein, who later said, "I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby."Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt "Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program". The context of this was that the program focused at its beginning mainly on developing an advanced crewed spacecraft, theApollo command and service module, succeeding theMercury program. Alunar landingbecame the focus of the program only in 1961.ThereafterProject Geminiinstead followed the Mercury program to test and study advanced crewed spaceflight technology. The Apollo program was conceived during the Eisenhower administration in early 1960, as a follow-up toProject Mercury. While the Mercurycapsulecould support only one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three. Possible missions included ferrying crews to aspace station,circumlunar flights, and eventual crewedlunar landings. In July 1960, NASA Deputy AdministratorHugh L. Drydenannounced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series ofSpace Task Groupconferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with amission modulecabin separate from thecommand module(piloting and reentry cabin), and apropulsion and equipment module. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded toGeneral Dynamics/Convair,General Electric, and theGlenn L. Martin Company. Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led byMaxime Faget, to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs. In November 1960,John F. Kennedywas elected president after acampaignthat promised American superiority over theSoviet Unionin the fields ofspace explorationandmissile defense. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the "missile gap" that he and many other senators said had developed between the Soviet Union and the United States due to the inaction of President Eisenhower.Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not "first but, first and, first if, but first period".Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew little about the technical details of the space program, and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a crewed Moon landing.When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA AdministratorJames E. Webbrequested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue. On April 12, 1961, SovietcosmonautYuri Gagarinbecame the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the US HouseCommittee on Science and Astronauticsone day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets. On April 20, Kennedy sent a memo toVice PresidentLyndon B. Johnson, asking Johnson to look into the status of America's space program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up.Johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that "we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership."His memo concluded that a crewed Moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the United States would achieve it first. On May 25, 1961, twenty days after the first American crewed spaceflightFreedom 7, Kennedy proposed the crewed Moon landing in aSpecial Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs: Now it is time to take longer strides—time for a great new American enterprise—time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on Earth. ...I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important in the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.[a] At the time of Kennedy's proposal, only one American had flown in space—less than a month earlier—and NASA had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit. Even some NASA employees doubted whether Kennedy's ambitious goal could be met.By 1963, Kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint US-USSR Moon mission, to eliminate duplication of effort. With the clear goal of a crewed landing replacing the more nebulous goals of space stations and circumlunar flights, NASA decided that, in order to make progress quickly, it would discard the feasibility study designs of Convair, GE, and Martin, and proceed with Faget's command and service module design. The mission module was determined to be useful only as an extra room, and therefore unnecessary.They used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961. On November 28, 1961, it was announced thatNorth American Aviationhad won the contract, although its bid was not rated as good as the Martin proposal. Webb, Dryden andRobert Seamanschose it in preference due to North American's longer association with NASA andits predecessor. Landing humans on the Moon by the end of 1969 required the most sudden burst of technological creativity, and the largest commitment of resources ($25 billion; $187 billion in 2024 US dollars)ever made by any nation in peacetime. At its peak, the Apollo program employed 400,000 people and required the support of over 20,000 industrial firms and universities. On July 1, 1960, NASA established theMarshall Space Flight Center(MSFC) inHuntsville, Alabama. MSFC designed the heavy lift-classSaturn launch vehicles, which would be required for Apollo. It became clear that managing the Apollo program would exceed the capabilities ofRobert R. Gilruth'sSpace Task Group, which had been directing the nation's crewed space program from NASA'sLangley Research Center. So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center, theManned Spacecraft Center(MSC). A site was chosen inHouston, Texas, on land donated byRice University, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19, 1961.It was also clear NASA would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from itsCape Canaveral Air Force Stationlaunch facilities in Florida, so a newMission Control Centerwould be included in the MSC. In September 1962, by which time two Project Mercury astronauts had orbited the Earth, Gilruth had moved his organization to rented space in Houston, and construction of the MSC facility was under way, Kennedy visited Rice to reiterate his challenge ina famous speech: But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, whyclimb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago,fly the Atlantic?...
We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills; because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win...[b] The MSC was completed in September 1963. It was renamed by theUnited States Congressin honor ofLyndon B. Johnsonsoon after his death in 1973. It also became clear that Apollo would outgrow theCanaveral launch facilitiesinFlorida. The two newest launch complexes were already being built for theSaturn IandIBrockets at the northernmost end:LC-34andLC-37. But an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the crewed lunar mission, so land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center (LOC) immediately north of Canaveral atMerritt Island. The design, development and construction of the center was conducted byKurt H. Debus, a member ofWernher von Braun's originalV-2 rocketengineering team. Debus was named the LOC's first Director.Construction began in November 1962. FollowingKennedy's death, President Johnson issued an executive order on November 29, 1963, to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor of Kennedy. The LOC includedLaunch Complex 39, aLaunch Control Center, and a 130-million-cubic-foot (3,700,000 m3)Vertical Assembly Building(VAB).in which the space vehicle (launch vehicle and spacecraft) would be assembled on amobile launcher platformand then moved by acrawler-transporterto one of several launch pads. Although at least three pads were planned, only two, designated AandB, were completed in October 1965. The LOC also included anOperations and Checkout Building(OCB) to whichGeminiand Apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles. The Apollo spacecraft could be tested in twovacuum chamberscapable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to 250,000 feet (76 km), which is nearly a vacuum. AdministratorWebbrealized that in order to keep Apollo costs under control, he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization, so he recruitedGeorge E. Muellerfor a high management job. Mueller accepted, on the condition that he have a say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo. Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF).On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to replace then Associate AdministratorD. Brainerd Holmeson his retirement effective September 1. Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth),Marshall Space Flight Center(von Braun), and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) reported to Mueller. Based on his industry experience on Air Force missile projects, Mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high-ranking officers in theU.S. Air Force, so he got Webb's permission to recruit GeneralSamuel C. Phillips, who gained a reputation for his effective management of theMinutemanprogram, as OMSF program controller. Phillips's superior officerBernard A. Schrieveragreed to loan Phillips to NASA, along with a staff of officers under him, on the condition that Phillips be made Apollo Program Director. Mueller agreed, and Phillips managed Apollo from January 1964, until it achieved the first human landing in July 1969, after which he returned to Air Force duty. Charles Fishman, inOne Giant Leap, estimated the number of people and organizations involved into the Apollo program as "410,000 men and women at some 20,000 different companies contributed to the effort". Once Kennedy had defined a goal, the Apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a spacecraft that could meet it while minimizing risk to human life, limiting cost, and not exceeding limits in possible technology and astronaut skill.  Four possible mission modes were considered: In early 1961, direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at NASA. Many engineers feared that rendezvous and docking, maneuvers that had not been attempted inEarth orbit, would be nearly impossible inlunar orbit. LOR advocates includingJohn Houboltat Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke "somewhat as a voice in the wilderness", Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question. Seamans's establishment of an ad hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend alaunch vehicleto be used in the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision.This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR—as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight,Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR.The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), who were heavily invested in direct ascent, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced byWernher von Braunat a briefing on June 7, 1962. But even after NASA reached internal agreement, it was far from smooth sailing. Kennedy'sscience advisorJerome Wiesner, who had expressed his opposition to human spaceflight to Kennedy before the President took office,and had opposed the decision to land people on the Moon, hired Golovin, who had left NASA, to chair his own "Space Vehicle Panel", ostensibly to monitor, but actually to second-guess NASA's decisions on theSaturn Vlaunch vehicle and LOR by forcing Shea, Seamans, and even Webb to defend themselves, delaying its formal announcement to the press on July 11, 1962, and forcing Webb to still hedge the decision as "tentative". Wiesner kept up the pressure, even making the disagreement public during a two-day September visit by the President toMarshall Space Flight Center. Wiesner blurted out "No, that's no good" in front of the press, during a presentation by von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was "still subject to final review". Webb held firm and issued arequest for proposalto candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the OctoberCuban Missile Crisis, and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb. NASA announced the selection ofGrummanas the LEM contractor in November 1962. Space historian James Hansen concludes that: Without NASA's adoption of this stubbornly held minority opinion in 1962, the United States may still have reached the Moon, but almost certainly it would not have been accomplished by the end of the 1960s, President Kennedy's target date. The LOR method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a "lifeboat" in the event of a failure of the command ship. Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. In 1964 an MSC study concluded, "TheLM[as lifeboat]... was finally dropped, because no single reasonableCSMfailure could be identified that would prohibit use of theSPS."Ironically, just such a failure happened onApollo 13when an oxygen tank explosion left the CSM without electrical power. The lunar module provided propulsion, electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely. Faget's preliminary Apollo design employed a cone-shaped command module, supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a command and service module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to LM (Lunar Module) but still pronounced/ˈlɛm/) which would take two individuals to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM. Thecommand module(CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing. It was the only component of the Apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early Apollo study designs. Its exterior was covered with anablative heat shield, and had its ownreaction control system(RCS) engines tocontrol its attitudeand steer itsatmospheric entrypath. Parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown. The module was 11.42 feet (3.48 m) tall, 12.83 feet (3.91 m) in diameter, and weighed approximately 12,250 pounds (5,560 kg). A cylindricalservice module(SM) supported the command module, with a service propulsion engine and an RCS with propellants, and afuel cellpower generation system withliquid hydrogenandliquid oxygenreactants. A high-gainS-bandantenna was used for long-distance communications on the lunar flights. On the extended lunar missions, an orbital scientific instrument package was carried. The service module was discarded just before reentry. The module was 24.6 feet (7.5 m) long and 12.83 feet (3.91 m) in diameter. The initial lunar flight version weighed approximately 51,300 pounds (23,300 kg) fully fueled, while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over 54,000 pounds (24,000 kg). North American Aviationwon the contract to build the CSM, and also the second stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight.Also, there was no provision for docking with the lunar module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development. TheApollo Lunar Module(LM) was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, each with its own engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately 33,300 pounds (15,100 kg), and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. Anextended lunar module(ELM) weighed over 36,200 pounds (16,400 kg), and allowed surface stays of more than three days.The contract for design and construction of the lunar module was awarded toGrumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen byThomas J. Kelly. Before the Apollo program began, Wernher von Braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles, theSaturn series, and the even largerNovaseries. In the midst of these plans, von Braun was transferred from the Army to NASA and was made Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center. The initial direct ascent plan to send the three-person Apollo command and service module directly to the lunar surface, on top of a large descent rocket stage, would require a Nova-class launcher, with a lunar payload capability of over 180,000 pounds (82,000 kg).The June 11, 1962, decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the Saturn V to replace the Nova, and the MSFC proceeded to develop theSaturn rocket familyfor Apollo. Since Apollo, like Mercury, used more than one launch vehicle for space missions, NASA used spacecraft-launch vehicle combination series numbers: AS-10x for Saturn I, AS-20x for Saturn IB, and AS-50x for Saturn V (compareMercury-Redstone 3,Mercury-Atlas 6) to designate and plan all missions, rather than numbering them sequentially as in Project Gemini. This was changed by the time human flights began. Since Apollo, like Mercury, would require alaunch escape system(LES) in case of a launch failure, a relatively small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system. A rocket bigger than theLittle Joeused by Mercury would be required, so theLittle Joe IIwas built byGeneral Dynamics/Convair. After an August 1963qualification test flight,four LES test flights (A-001through004) were made at theWhite Sands Missile Rangebetween May 1964 and January 1966. Saturn I, the first US heavy lift launch vehicle, was initially planned to launch partially equipped CSMs in low Earth orbit tests. TheS-Ifirst stage burnedRP-1with liquid oxygen (LOX) oxidizer in eight clusteredRocketdyne H-1engines, to produce 1,500,000 pounds-force (6,670 kN) of thrust. TheS-IVsecond stage used six liquid hydrogen-fueledPratt & WhitneyRL-10engines with 90,000 pounds-force (400 kN) of thrust. TheS-Vthird stage flew inactively on Saturn I four times. The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC-34, with only the first stage live, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water. The first flight with a live S-IV was launched from LC-37. This was followed by five launches ofboilerplateCSMs (designatedAS-101throughAS-105) into orbit in 1964 and 1965. The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carryingPegasussatellites, which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity ofmicrometeoriteimpacts. In September 1962, NASA planned to launch four crewed CSM flights on the Saturn I from late 1965 through 1966, concurrent with Project Gemini. The 22,500-pound (10,200 kg) payload capacitywould have severely limited the systems which could be included, so the decision was made in October 1963 to use the upratedSaturn IBfor all crewed Earth orbital flights. The Saturn IB was an upgraded version of the Saturn I. TheS-IBfirst stage increased the thrust to 1,600,000 pounds-force (7,120 kN) by uprating the H-1 engine. The second stage replaced the S-IV with theS-IVB-200, powered by a singleJ-2engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with LOX, to produce 200,000pounds-force(890kN) of thrust.A restartable version of the S-IVB was used as the third stage of the Saturn V. The Saturn IB could send over 40,000 pounds (18,100 kg) into low Earth orbit, sufficient for a partially fueled CSM or the LM.Saturn IB launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-200 series number, "AS" indicating "Apollo Saturn" and the "2" indicating the second member of the Saturn rocket family. Saturn V launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-500 series number, "AS" indicating "Apollo Saturn" and the "5" indicating Saturn V.The three-stage Saturn V was designed to send a fully fueled CSM and LM to the Moon. It was 33 feet (10.1 m) in diameter and stood 363 feet (110.6 m) tall with its 96,800-pound (43,900 kg) lunar payload. Its capability grew to 103,600 pounds (47,000 kg) for the later advanced lunar landings. TheS-ICfirst stage burned RP-1/LOX for a rated thrust of 7,500,000 pounds-force (33,400 kN), which was upgraded to 7,610,000 pounds-force (33,900 kN). The second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen; the third stage was a modified version of the S-IVB, with thrust increased to 230,000 pounds-force (1,020 kN) and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching aparking orbit. NASA's director of flight crew operations during the Apollo program wasDonald K. "Deke" Slayton, one of the originalMercury Sevenastronauts who was medically grounded in September 1962 due to aheart murmur. Slayton was responsible for making all Gemini and Apollo crew assignments. Thirty-two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the Apollo program. Twenty-four of these left Earth's orbit and flew around the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972 (three of them twice). Half of the 24 walked on the Moon's surface, though none of them returned to it after landing once. One of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist. Of the 32,Gus Grissom,Ed White, andRoger Chaffeewere killed during a ground test in preparation for theApollo 1mission. The Apollo astronauts were chosen from the Project Mercury and Gemini veterans, plus from two later astronaut groups. All missions were commanded by Gemini or Mercury veterans. Crews on all development flights (except the Earth orbit CSM development flights) through the first two landings on Apollo 11 andApollo 12, included at least two (sometimes three) Gemini veterans.Harrison Schmitt, a geologist, was the firstNASA scientist astronautto fly in space, and landed on the Moon on the last mission, Apollo 17. Schmitt participated in thelunar geologytraining of all of the Apollo landing crews. NASA awarded all 32 of these astronauts its highest honor, theDistinguished Service Medal, given for "distinguished service, ability, or courage", and personal "contribution representing substantial progress to the NASA mission". The medals were awarded posthumously to Grissom, White, and Chaffee in 1969, then to the crews of all missions fromApollo 8onward. The crew that flew the first Earth orbital test missionApollo 7,Walter M. Schirra,Donn Eisele, andWalter Cunningham, were awarded the lesserNASA Exceptional Service Medal, because of discipline problems with theflight director's orders during their flight. In October 2008, theNASA Administratordecided to award them the Distinguished Service Medals. For Schirra and Eisele, this was posthumously. The first lunar landing mission was planned to proceed: Two Block I CSMs were launched from LC-34 on suborbital flights in 1966 with the Saturn IB. The first,AS-201launched on February 26, reached an altitude of 265.7 nautical miles (492.1 km) and splashed down 4,577 nautical miles (8,477 km) downrange in theAtlantic Ocean.The second,AS-202on August 25, reached 617.1 nautical miles (1,142.9 km) altitude and was recovered 13,900 nautical miles (25,700 km) downrange in the Pacific Ocean. These flights validated the service module engine and the command module heat shield. A third Saturn IB test,AS-203launched from pad 37, went into orbit to support design of the S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nose cone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight. Two crewed orbital Block I CSM missions were planned: AS-204 and AS-205. The Block I crew positions were titled Command Pilot, Senior Pilot, and Pilot. The Senior Pilot would assume navigation duties, while the Pilot would function as a systems engineer.The astronauts would weara modified version of the Gemini spacesuit. After an uncrewed LM test flight AS-206, a crew would fly the first Block II CSM and LM in a dual mission known as AS-207/208, or AS-278 (each spacecraft would be launched on a separate Saturn IB).The Block II crew positions were titled Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot. The astronauts would begin wearing a newApollo A6L spacesuit, designed to accommodate lunarextravehicular activity(EVA). The traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear "fishbowl" type for greater visibility, and the lunar surface EVA suit would include a water-cooled undergarment. Deke Slayton, the groundedMercury astronautwho became director of flight crew operations for the Gemini and Apollo programs, selected the first Apollo crew in January 1966, with Grissom as Command Pilot, White as Senior Pilot, and rookieDonn F. Eiseleas Pilot. But Eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard theKC135 weightlessness training aircraft, and had to undergo surgery on January 27. Slayton replaced him with Chaffee.NASA announced the final crew selection for AS-204 on March 21, 1966, with the backup crew consisting of Gemini veteransJames McDivittandDavid Scott, with rookieRussell L. "Rusty" Schweickart. Mercury/Gemini veteranWally Schirra, Eisele, and rookieWalter Cunninghamwere announced on September 29 as the prime crew for AS-205. In December 1966, the AS-205 mission was canceled, since the validation of the CSM would be accomplished on the 14-day first flight, and AS-205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft. Its Saturn IB was allocated to the dual mission, now redesignated AS-205/208 or AS-258, planned for August 1967. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were promoted to the prime AS-258 crew, and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the Apollo1 backup crew. The spacecraft for the AS-202 and AS-204 missions were delivered by North American Aviation to the Kennedy Space Center with long lists of equipment problems which had to be corrected before flight; these delays caused the launch of AS-202 to slip behind AS-203, and eliminated hopes the first crewed mission might be ready to launch as soon as November 1966, concurrently with the last Gemini mission. Eventually, the planned AS-204 flight date was pushed to February 21, 1967. North American Aviation was prime contractor not only for the Apollo CSM, but for the SaturnVS-IIsecond stage as well, and delays in this stage pushed the first uncrewed SaturnV flight AS-501 from late 1966 to November 1967. (The initial assembly of AS-501 had to use a dummy spacer spool in place of the stage.) The problems with North American were severe enough in late 1965 to cause Manned Space Flight Administrator George Mueller to appoint program director Samuel Phillips to head a "tiger team" to investigate North American's problems and identify corrections. Phillips documented his findings in a December 19 letter to NAA presidentLee Atwood, with a strongly worded letter by Mueller, and also gave a presentation of the results to Mueller and Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans.Meanwhile,Grummanwas also encountering problems with the Lunar Module, eliminating hopes it would be ready for crewed flight in 1967, not long after the first crewed CSM flights. Grissom, White, and Chaffee decided to name their flight Apollo1 as a motivational focus on the first crewed flight. They trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at North American, and in the altitude chamber at the Kennedy Space Center. A "plugs-out" test was planned for January, which would simulate a launch countdown on LC-34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power. If successful, this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the February 21 launch, with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled. The plugs-out test began on the morning of January 27, 1967, and immediately was plagued with problems. First, the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits which delayed the sealing of the hatch. Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst, allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened. NASA immediately convened an accident review board, overseen by both houses of Congress. While the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex, the review board concluded that "deficiencies existed in command module design, workmanship and quality control".At the insistence of NASA Administrator Webb, North American removedHarrison Stormsas command module program manager.Webb also reassigned Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) ManagerJoseph Francis Shea, replacing him withGeorge Low. To remedy the causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II spacecraft and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials.The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block Iplug-typehatch cover with a quick-release, outward opening door.NASA discontinued the crewed Block I program, using the BlockI spacecraft only for uncrewed SaturnV flights. Crew members would also exclusively wear modified, fire-resistant A7L Block II space suits, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not. On April 24, 1967, Mueller published an official Apollo mission numbering scheme, using sequential numbers for all flights, crewed or uncrewed. The sequence would start withApollo 4to cover the first three uncrewed flights while retiring the Apollo1 designation to honor the crew, per their widows' wishes. In September 1967, Mueller approved asequence of mission typeswhich had to be accomplished in order to achieve the crewed lunar landing. Each step had to be accomplished before the next ones could be performed, and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary; therefore letters were used instead of numbers. TheAmissions were uncrewed Saturn V validation;Bwas uncrewed LM validation using the Saturn IB;Cwas crewed CSM Earth orbit validation using the Saturn IB;Dwas the first crewed CSM/LM flight (this replaced AS-258, using a single Saturn V launch);Ewould be a higher Earth orbit CSM/LM flight;Fwould be the first lunar mission, testing the LM in lunar orbit but without landing (a "dress rehearsal"); andGwould be the first crewed landing. The list of types covered follow-on lunar exploration to includeHlunar landings,Ifor lunar orbital survey missions, andJfor extended-stay lunar landings. The delay in the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA to catch up on human-rating the LM and SaturnV. Apollo4 (AS-501) was the first uncrewed flight of the SaturnV, carrying a BlockI CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the command module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed. Apollo 5(AS-204) was the first uncrewed test flight of the LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error, which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a "fire-in-the-hole" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage. Although Grumman wanted a second uncrewed test, George Low decided the next LM flight would be crewed. This was followed on April 4, 1968, byApollo 6(AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the service module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experiencedpogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo6 problems, NASA declared the SaturnV ready to fly crew, canceling a third uncrewed test. Apollo 7, launched from LC-34 on October 11, 1968, was the Cmission, crewed bySchirra,Eisele, andCunningham. It was an 11-day Earth-orbital flight which tested the CSM systems. Apollo 8was planned to be the D mission in December 1968, crewed by McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart, launched on a SaturnV instead of two Saturn IBs.In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time. Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the Dmission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track. The Soviet Union had sent two tortoises, mealworms, wine flies, and other lifeforms around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboardZond 5, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts.The decision was not announced publicly until completion of Apollo 7. Gemini veteransFrank BormanandJim Lovell, and rookieWilliam Anderscaptured the world's attention by making ten lunar orbits in 20 hours, transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface onChristmas Eve, and returning safely to Earth. The following March, LM flight, rendezvous and docking were demonstrated in Earth orbit onApollo 9, and Schweickart tested the full lunarEVA suitwith itsportable life support system(PLSS) outside the LM.The F mission was carried out onApollo 10in May 1969 by Gemini veteransThomas P. Stafford,John YoungandEugene Cernan. Stafford and Cernan took the LM to within 50,000 feet (15 km) of the lunar surface. The G mission was achieved onApollo 11in July 1969 by an all-Gemini veteran crew consisting ofNeil Armstrong,Michael CollinsandBuzz Aldrin. Armstrong and Aldrin performed the first landing at theSea of Tranquilityat 20:17:40UTCon July 20, 1969. They spent a total of 21 hours, 36 minutes on the surface, and spent 2hours, 31 minutes outside the spacecraft,walking on the surface, taking photographs, collecting material samples, and deploying automated scientific instruments, while continuously sendingblack-and-white televisionback to Earth. The astronauts returned safely on July 24. That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind. —Neil Armstrong, just after stepping onto the Moon's surface In November 1969,Charles "Pete" Conradbecame the third person to step onto the Moon, which he did while speaking more informally than had Armstrong: Whoopee! Man, that may have been a small one forNeil, but that's a long one for me. Conrad and rookieAlan L. Beanmade a precision landing of Apollo 12 within walking distance of theSurveyor 3uncrewed lunar probe, which had landed in April 1967 on theOcean of Storms. The command module pilot was Gemini veteranRichard F. Gordon Jr.Conrad and Bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera, but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the Sun. They made two EVAs totaling 7hours and 45 minutes.On one, they walked to the Surveyor, photographed it, and removed some parts which they returned to Earth. The contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs was enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. Shortly after Apollo 11, NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites after Apollo 12, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry theLunar Roving Vehicle(LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit wasrevised for the extended missionsto allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV. The success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander, with two rookies. Apollo 13 launched Lovell,Jack Swigert, andFred Haisein April 1970, headed for theFra Mauro formation. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a "lifeboat" to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added. About the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for thedevelopmentof the upcomingSpace Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at theJohn F. Kennedy Space Centeron Merritt Island, Florida,George C. Marshall Space CenterinHuntsville, Alabama,Michoud Assembly FacilityinNew Orleans, Louisiana, andLyndon B. Johnson Space Centerin Houston, Texas. The cutbacks forced mission planners to reassess the original planned landing sites in order to achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions.Apollo 15had been planned to be the last of the H series missions, but since there would be only two subsequent missions left, it was changed to the first of three J missions. Apollo 13's Fra Mauro mission was reassigned toApollo 14, commanded in February 1971 by Mercury veteranAlan Shepard, withStuart RoosaandEdgar Mitchell.This time the mission was successful. Shepard and Mitchell spent 33 hours and 31 minutes on the surface,and completed two EVAs totalling 9hours 24 minutes, which was a record for the longest EVA by a lunar crew at the time. In August 1971, just after conclusion of the Apollo 15 mission, PresidentRichard Nixonproposed canceling the two remaining lunar landing missions, Apollo 16 and 17.Office of Management and BudgetDeputy DirectorCaspar Weinbergerwas opposed to this, and persuaded Nixon to keep the remaining missions. Apollo 15 was launched on July 26, 1971, withDavid Scott,Alfred WordenandJames Irwin. Scott and Irwin landed on July 30 nearHadley Rille, and spent just under two days, 19 hours on the surface. In over 18 hours of EVA, they collected about 77 kilograms (170 lb) of lunar material. Apollo 16 landed in theDescartes Highlandson April 20, 1972. The crew was commanded by John Young, withKen MattinglyandCharles Duke. Young and Duke spent just under three days on the surface, with a total of over 20 hours EVA. Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo program, landing in theTaurus–Littrowregion in December 1972. Eugene Cernan commandedRonald E. Evansand NASA's first scientist-astronaut, geologistHarrison H. Schmitt.Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18,but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing.Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA. Several missions were planned for but were canceled before details were finalized. Source:Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference(Orloff 2004). The Apollo program returned over 382 kg (842 lb) of lunar rocks andsoilto theLunar Receiving Laboratoryin Houston.Today, 75% of the samples are stored at theLunar Sample Laboratory Facilitybuilt in 1979. The rocks collected from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured byradiometric datingtechniques. They range in age from about 3.2 billion years for thebasalticsamples derived from thelunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from thehighlandscrust.As such, they represent samples from a very early period in the development of theSolar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed theGenesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission.Thisanorthositerock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineralanorthite, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust.A geochemical component calledKREEPwas discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart.KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (seelunar magma ocean). Almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects. Many samples appear to be pitted withmicrometeoroidimpact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high-pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are ofimpact melt(materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples returned from the Moon are highlybrecciatedas a result of being subjected to multiple impact events. From analyses of the composition of the returned lunar samples, it is now believed that the Moon wascreated through the impactof a large astronomical body with Earth. Apollo cost $25.4 billion or approximately $257 billion (2023) using improved cost analysis. Of this amount, $20.2 billion ($149 billion adjusted) was spent on the design, development, and production of theSaturn familyof launch vehicles, theApollo spacecraft,spacesuits,scientific experiments, and mission operations. The cost of constructing and operating Apollo-related ground facilities, such as the NASA human spaceflight centers and theglobal tracking and data acquisition network, added an additional $5.2 billion ($38.3 billion adjusted). The amount grows to $28 billion ($280 billion adjusted) if the costs for related projects such as Project Gemini and the roboticRanger,Surveyor, andLunar Orbiterprograms are included. NASA's official cost breakdown, as reported to Congress in the Spring of 1973, is as follows: Accurate estimates of human spaceflight costs were difficult in the early 1960s, as the capability was new and management experience was lacking. Preliminary cost analysis by NASA estimated $7 billion – $12 billion for a crewed lunar landing effort. NASA Administrator James Webb increased this estimate to $20 billion before reporting it to Vice President Johnson in April 1961. Project Apollo was a massive undertaking, representing the largest research and development project in peacetime. At its peak, it employed over 400,000 employees and contractors around the country and accounted for more than half of NASA's total spending in the 1960s.After the first Moon landing, public and political interest waned, including that of President Nixon, who wanted to rein in federal spending.NASA's budget could not sustain Apollo missions which cost, on average, $445 million ($2.73 billion adjusted)each while simultaneouslydeveloping the Space Shuttle. The final fiscal year of Apollo funding was 1973. Looking beyond the crewed lunar landings, NASA investigated several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (Apollo X) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using the space in theSpacecraft Lunar Module Adapter(SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by theApollo Telescope Mount, which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack.The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for aVenus fly-by mission. The S-IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board. DubbedSkylab, it was assembled on the ground rather than in space, and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a Saturn V. It was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount. Skylab's last crew departed the station on February 8, 1974, and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979 after development of theSpace Shuttlewas delayed too long to save it. TheApollo–Soyuzprogram also used Apollo hardware for the first joint nation spaceflight, paving the way for future cooperation with other nations in theSpace ShuttleandInternational Space Stationprograms. In 2008,Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency'sSELENEprobe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the Apollo 15 Lunar Module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface. Beginning in 2009, NASA'sroboticLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, while orbiting 50 kilometers (31 mi) above the Moon, photographed the remnants of the Apollo program left on the lunar surface, and each site where crewed Apollo flights landed.All ofU.S. flagsleft on the Moon during the Apollo missions were found to still be standing, with the exception of the one left during the Apollo 11 mission, which was blown over during that mission's lift-off from the lunar surface; the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown.The flags cannot be seen through a telescope from Earth. In a November 16, 2009, editorial,The New York Timesopined: [T]here's something terribly wistful about these photographs of the Apollo landing sites. The detail is such that if Neil Armstrong were walking there now, we could make him out, make out his footsteps even, like the astronaut footpath clearly visible in the photos of the Apollo 14 site. Perhaps the wistfulness is caused by the sense of simple grandeur in those Apollo missions. Perhaps, too, it's a reminder of the risk we all felt after the Eagle had landed—the possibility that it might be unable to lift off again and the astronauts would be stranded on the Moon. But it may also be that a photograph like this one is as close as we're able to come to looking directly back into the human past...
There the [Apollo 11] lunar module sits, parked just where it landed 40 years ago, as if it still really were 40 years ago and all the time since merely imaginary. The Apollo program has been described as the greatest technological achievement in human history.Apollo stimulated many areas of technology, leading to over 1,800 spinoff products as of 2015, including advances in the development ofcordlesspower tools,fireproof materials,heart monitors,solar panels,digital imaging, and the use ofliquid methaneas fuel.Theflight computerdesign used in both the lunar and command modules was, along with thePolarisandMinutemanmissile systems, the driving force behind early research intointegrated circuits(ICs). By 1963, Apollo was using 60 percent of the United States' production of ICs. The crucial difference between the requirements of Apollo and the missile programs was Apollo's much greater need for reliability. Whilethe NavyandAir Forcecould work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles, the political and financial cost of failure of an Apollo mission was unacceptably high. Technologies and techniques required for Apollo were developed by Project Gemini.The Apollo project was enabled by NASA's adoption of new advances insemiconductorelectronic technology, includingmetal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors(MOSFETs) in theInterplanetary Monitoring Platform(IMP)andsiliconintegrated circuitchips in theApollo Guidance Computer(AGC). The crew of Apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the Earth and the Moon back to Earth, and read from the creation story in theBook of Genesis, onChristmas Eve1968.An estimated one-quarter of the population of the world saw—either live or delayed—the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon,and an estimated one-fifth of the population of the world watched the live transmission of the Apollo 11 moonwalk. The Apollo program also affectedenvironmental activismin the 1970s due to photos taken by the astronauts. The most well known includeEarthrise, taken byWilliam Anderson Apollo 8, andThe Blue Marble, taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts.The Blue Marblewas released during a surge in environmentalism, and became a symbol of the environmental movement as a depiction of Earth's frailty, vulnerability, and isolation amid the vast expanse of space. According toThe Economist, Apollo succeeded in accomplishing President Kennedy's goal of taking on the Soviet Union in theSpace Raceby accomplishing a singular and significant achievement, to demonstrate the superiority of thefree-market system. The publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy. Prior to Apollo 11's 40th anniversary in 2009, NASA searched for the original videotapes of the mission's live televised moonwalk. After an exhaustive three-year search, it was concluded that the tapes had probably been erased and reused. A new digitally remastered version of the best available broadcast television footage was released instead. Numerous documentary films cover the Apollo program and the Space Race, including: Some missions have beendramatized: The Apollo program has been the focus of several works of fiction, including:

TheHubble Space Telescope(HSTorHubble) is aspace telescopethat was launched intolow Earth orbitin 1990 and remains in operation. It was not thefirst space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon forastronomy. The Hubble Space Telescope is named after astronomerEdwin Hubbleand is one ofNASA'sGreat Observatories. TheSpace Telescope Science Institute(STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while theGoddard Space Flight Center(GSFC) controls the spacecraft. Hubble features a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) mirror, and its five main instruments observe in theultraviolet,visible, andnear-infraredregions of theelectromagnetic spectrum. Hubble's orbit outside the distortion ofEarth's atmosphereallows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs inastrophysics, such asdetermining the rate of expansion of the universe. The Hubble Space Telescope was funded and built in the 1970s by NASA with contributions from theEuropean Space Agency. Its intended launch was in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the 1986Challengerdisaster. Hubble was launched onSTS-31in 1990, but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly, resulting inspherical aberrationthat compromised the telescope's capabilities. The optics were corrected to their intended quality by a servicing mission,STS-61, in 1993. Hubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five Space Shuttle missions repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. Thefifth missionwas initially canceled on safety grounds following theColumbiadisaster(2003), but afterNASA administratorMichael D. Griffinapproved it, the servicing mission was completed in 2009. Hubble completed 30 years of operation in April 2020and is predicted to last until 2030 to 2040. Hubble is the visible light telescope in NASA'sGreat Observatories program; other parts of the spectrum are covered by theCompton Gamma Ray Observatory, theChandra X-ray Observatory, and theSpitzer Space Telescope(which covers the infrared bands).The mid-IR-to-visible band successor to the Hubble telescope is theJames Webb Space Telescope(JWST), which was launched on December 25, 2021, with theNancy Grace Roman Space Telescopedue to follow in 2027. In 1923Hermann Oberth, considered a father of modern rocketry along withRobert H. GoddardandKonstantin Tsiolkovsky, publishedDie Rakete zu den Planetenräumen("The Rocket into Planetary Space"), which mentioned how a telescope could be propelled intoEarthorbit by a rocket. The history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced to 1946, toastronomerLyman Spitzer's paper "Astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory".In it, he discussed the two main advantages that a space-based observatory would have over ground-based telescopes. First, theangular resolution(the smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished) would be limited only bydiffraction, rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere, which causes stars to twinkle, known to astronomers asseeing. At that time ground-based telescopes were limited to resolutions of 0.5–1.0arcseconds, compared to a theoretical diffraction-limited resolution of about 0.05 arcsec for an optical telescope with amirror2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) in diameter. Second, a space-based telescope could observeinfraredand ultraviolet light, which are strongly absorbed by theatmosphere of Earth. Spitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope.In 1962, a report by the U.S.National Academy of Sciencesrecommended development of aspace telescopeas part of thespace program, and in 1965, Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope. Also crucial was the work ofNancy Grace Roman, the "Mother of Hubble".Well before it became an officialNASAproject, she gave public lectures touting the scientific value of the telescope. After it was approved, she became the program scientist, setting up the steering committee in charge of making astronomer needs feasible to implementand writing testimony toCongressthroughout the 1970s to advocate continued funding of the telescope.Her work as project scientist helped set the standards for NASA's operation of large scientific projects. Space-based astronomy had begun on a very small scale followingWorld War II, as scientists made use of developments that had taken place inrockettechnology. The first ultravioletspectrumof theSunwas obtained in 1946,and NASA launched theOrbiting Solar Observatory(OSO) to obtain UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra in 1962.Anorbiting solar telescopewas launched in 1962 by the United Kingdom as part of theAriel programme, and in 1966 NASA launched the firstOrbiting Astronomical Observatory(OAO) mission. OAO-1's battery failed after three days, terminating the mission. It was followed byOrbiting Astronomical Observatory 2(OAO-2), which carried out ultraviolet observations ofstarsandgalaxiesfrom its launch in 1968 until 1972, well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year. The OSO and OAO missions demonstrated the important role space-based observations could play in astronomy. In 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-basedreflecting telescopewith a mirror 3 m (9.8 ft) in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for crewed maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusableSpace Shuttleindicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available. The continuing success of the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, and the other to determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. TheU.S. Congressquestioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974,public spendingcuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project. In 1977, then NASA AdministratorJames C. Fletcherproposed a token $5million for Hubble in NASA's budget. Then NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science,Noel Hinners, instead cut all funding for Hubble, gambling that this would galvanize the scientific community into fighting for full funding. As Hinners recalls: It was clear that year that we weren't going to be able to get a full-up start. There was some opposition on [Capitol] Hill to getting a new start on [Hubble]. It was driven, in large part as I recall, by the budget situation. Jim Fletcher proposed that we put in five million as a placeholder. I didn't like that idea. It was, in today's vernacular, a "sop" to the astronomy community. "There's something in there, so all is well". I figured in my own little head that to get that community energized we'd be better off zeroing it out. Then they would say, "Whoa, we're in deep trouble", and it would marshal the troops. So I advocated that we not put anything in. I don't remember any of the detailed discussions or whether there were any, but Jim went along with that so we zeroed it out. It had, from my perspective, the desired impact of stimulating the astronomy community to renew their efforts on the lobbying front. While I like to think in hindsight it was a brilliant political move, I'm not sure I thought it through all that well. It was something that was spur of the moment. [...] five million would let them think that all is well anyway, but it's not. So let's give them a message. My own thinking, get them stimulated to get into action. Zeroing it out would certainly give that message. I think it was as simple as that. Didn't talk to anybody else about doing it first, just, "Let's go do that". Voila, it worked. Don't know whether I'd do that again. The political ploy worked. In response to Hubble being zeroed out of NASA's budget, a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers. Many astronomers metcongressmenandsenatorsin person, and large-scale letter-writing campaigns were organized. TheNational Academy of Sciencespublished a report emphasizing the need for a space telescope, and eventually, the Senate agreed to half the budget that had originally been approved by Congress. The funding issues led to a reduction in the scale of the project, with the proposed mirror diameter reduced from 3 m to 2.4 m, both to cut costsand to allow a more compact and effective configuration for the telescope hardware. A proposed precursor 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) space telescope to test the systems to be used on the main satellite was dropped, and budgetary concerns also prompted collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA agreed to provide funding and supply one of the first generation instruments for the telescope, as well as thesolar cellsthat would power it, and staff to work on the telescope in the United States, in return for European astronomers being guaranteed at least 15% of the observing time on the telescope.Congress eventually approved funding of $36million for 1978, and the design of the LST began in earnest, aiming for a launch date of 1983.In 1983, the telescope was named afterEdwin Hubble,who confirmed one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th century, made byGeorges Lemaître, that theuniverseisexpanding. Once the Space Telescope project had been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions.Marshall Space Flight Center(MSFC) was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, whileGoddard Space Flight Centerwas given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission.MSFC commissioned the optics companyPerkin-Elmerto design and build theoptical telescope assembly(OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope.Lockheedwas commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed. Optically, the HST is aCassegrain reflectorofRitchey–Chrétien design, as are most large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, is known for good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes that are hard to fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to anaccuracyof about a tenth of thewavelengthofvisible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to bediffraction limitedto take full advantage of the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10 nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light.On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum infrared performance in mind, e.g. the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope. Perkin-Elmer (PE) intended to use custom-built and extremely sophisticatedcomputer-controlled polishing machinesto grind the mirror to the required shape.However, in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract toKodakto construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques.(The team of Kodak andItekalso bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later causedproblems.)The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at theNational Air and Space Museum.An Itek mirror built as part of the effort is now used in the 2.4 m telescope at theMagdalena Ridge Observatory. Construction of the Perkin-Elmer mirror began in 1979, starting with a blank manufactured byCorningfrom their ultra-low expansion glass. To keep the mirror's weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates, each 25 mm (0.98 in) thick, sandwiching ahoneycomblattice. Perkin-Elmer simulatedmicrogravityby supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force.This ensured the mirror's final shape would be correct and to specification when deployed. Mirror polishing continued until May 1981. NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin-Elmer's managerial structure, and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget. To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and moved the launch date of the telescope to October 1984.The mirror was completed by the end of 1981; it was washed using 9,100 L (2,000 imp gal; 2,400 US gal) of hot,deionized waterand then received a reflective coating of 65‑nm‑thickaluminumand a protective coating of 25‑nm‑thickmagnesium fluoride. Doubts continued to be expressed about Perkin-Elmer's competence on a project of this importance, as their budget and timescale for producing the rest of the OTA continued to inflate. In response to a schedule described as "unsettled and changing daily", NASA postponed the launch date of the telescope until April 1985. Perkin-Elmer's schedules continued to slip at a rate of about one month per quarter, and at times delays reached one day for each day of work. NASA was forced to postpone the launch date until March and then September 1986. By this time, the total project budget had risen to $1.175billion. The spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight into the darkness of Earth'sshadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud ofmulti-layer insulationkeeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell in which the telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, agraphite-epoxyframe keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned.Because graphite composites arehygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space. As well as electrical power systems, thePointing Control Systemcontrols HST orientation using five types of sensors (magnetic sensors, optical sensors, and six gyroscopes) and two types ofactuators(reaction wheelsandmagnetic torquers). While construction of the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than the construction of the OTA, Lockheed experienced some budget and schedule slippage, and by the summer 1985, construction of the spacecraft was 30% over budget and three months behind schedule. An MSFC report said Lockheed tended to rely on NASA directions rather than take their own initiative in the construction. The two initial, primary computers on the HST were the 1.25MHzDF-224system, built by Rockwell Autonetics, which contained three redundant CPUs, and two redundantNSSC-1(NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer, Model 1) systems, developed byWestinghouseand GSFC usingdiode–transistor logic(DTL). A co-processor for the DF-224 was added during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, which consisted of two redundant strings of an Intel-based 80386 processor with an 80387 math co-processor.The DF-224 and its 386 co-processor were replaced by a 25MHz Intel-based 80486 processor system duringServicing Mission 3Ain 1999.The new computer is 20 times faster, with six times more memory, than theDF-224it replaced. It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages. Additionally, some of the science instruments and components had their own embedded microprocessor-based control systems. The MATs (Multiple Access Transponder) components, MAT-1 and MAT-2, use Hughes Aircraft CDP1802CD microprocessors.TheWide Field and Planetary Camera(WFPC) also used anRCA 1802 microprocessor(or possibly the older 1801 version).The WFPC-1 was replaced by theWFPC-2during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, which was then replaced by theWide Field Camera 3(WFC3) during Servicing Mission 4 in 2009. The upgrade extended Hubble's capability of seeing deeper into the universe and providing images in three broad regions of the spectrum. When launched, the HST carried five scientific instruments: the Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC), Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS), High Speed Photometer (HSP), Faint Object Camera (FOC) and the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS). WF/PC used a radial instrument bay, and the other four instruments were each installed in an axial instrument bay. WF/PC was a high-resolution imaging device primarily intended for optical observations. It was built by NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory, and incorporated a set of 48filtersisolatingspectral linesof particular astrophysical interest. The instrument contained eightcharge-coupled device(CCD) chips divided between two cameras, each using four CCDs. Each CCD has a resolution of 0.64 megapixels.The wide field camera (WFC) covered a large angular field at the expense of resolution, while the planetary camera (PC) took images at a longer effectivefocal lengththan the WF chips, giving it a greater magnification. TheGoddard High Resolution Spectrograph(GHRS) was aspectrographdesigned to operate in the ultraviolet. It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and could achieve aspectral resolutionof 90,000.Also optimized for ultraviolet observations were the FOC and FOS, which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on Hubble. Rather than CCDs, these three instruments usedphoton-countingdigiconsas their detectors. The FOC was constructed by ESA, while theUniversity of California, San Diego, andMartin Marietta Corporationbuilt the FOS. The final instrument was the HSP, designed and built at theUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison. It was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations ofvariable starsand other astronomical objects varying in brightness. It could take up to 100,000 measurements per second with aphotometricaccuracy of about 2% or better. HST's guidance system can also be used as a scientific instrument. Its threeFine Guidance Sensors(FGS) are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation, but can also be used to carry out extremely accurateastrometry; measurements accurate to within 0.0003 arcseconds have been achieved. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers. STScI is operated by theAssociation of Universities for Research in Astronomy(AURA) and is physically located inBaltimore, Marylandon the Homewood campus ofJohns Hopkins University, one of the 39 U.S. universities and seven international affiliates that make up the AURA consortium. STScI was established in 1981after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. NASA had wanted to keep this function in-house, but scientists wanted it to be based in anacademicestablishment.TheSpace Telescope European Coordinating Facility(ST-ECF), established atGarching bei MünchennearMunichin 1984, provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011, when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre. One complex task that falls to STScI is scheduling observations for the telescope.Hubble is in a low-Earth orbit to enable servicing missions, which results in most astronomical targets beingoccultedby the Earth for slightly less than half of each orbit. Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through theSouth Atlantic Anomalydue to elevatedradiationlevels, and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun (precluding observations ofMercury), Moon and Earth. The solar avoidance angle is about 50°, to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA. Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the FGSs, and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments. If the FGSs are turned off, the Moon and Earth can be observed. Earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat-fields for the WFPC1 instrument. There is a so-called continuous viewing zone (CVZ), within roughly 24° of Hubble'sorbital poles, in which targets are notoccultedfor long periods. Due to theprecessionof the orbit, the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks. Because thelimbof the Earth is always within about 30° of regions within the CVZ, the brightness of scatteredearthshinemay be elevated for long periods during CVZ observations. Hubble orbits in low Earth orbit at an altitude of approximately 540 kilometers (340 mi) and an inclination of 28.5°.The position along its orbit changes over time in a way that is not accurately predictable. The density of the upper atmosphere varies according to many factors, and this means Hubble's predicted position for six weeks' time could be in error by up to 4,000 km (2,500 mi). Observation schedules are typically finalized only a few days in advance, as a longer lead time would mean there was a chance the target would be unobservable by the time it was due to be observed.Engineering support for HST is provided by NASA and contractor personnel at the Goddard Space Flight Center inGreenbelt, Maryland, 48 km (30 mi) south of the STScI. Hubble's operation is monitored 24 hours per day by four teams of flight controllers who make up Hubble's Flight Operations Team. By January 1986, the planned launch date for Hubble that October looked feasible, but theChallengerdisasterbrought the U.S. space program to a halt, grounded the Shuttle fleet, and forced the launch to be postponed for several years. During this delay the telescope was kept in a clean room, powered up and purged with nitrogen, until a launch could be rescheduled. This costly situation (about $6million per month) pushed the overall costs of the project higher. However, this delay allowed time for engineers to perform extensive tests, swap out a possibly failure-prone battery, and make other improvements.Furthermore, the ground software needed to control Hubble was not ready in 1986, and was barely ready by the 1990 launch.Following the resumption of shuttle flights,Space ShuttleDiscoverysuccessfully launched the Hubble on April 24, 1990, as part of the STS-31 mission. At launch, NASA had spent approximately $4.7 billion in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars on the project.Hubble's cumulative costs are estimated to be about $11.3billion in 2015 dollars, which include all subsequent servicing costs, but not ongoing operations, making it the most expensive science mission in NASA history. Hubble accommodates five science instruments at a given time, plus theFine Guidance Sensors, which are mainly used for aiming the telescope but are occasionally used for scientificastrometrymeasurements. Early instruments were replaced with more advanced ones during the Shuttle servicing missions. COSTAR was a corrective optics device rather than a science instrument, but occupied one of the four axial instrument bays. Since the final servicing mission in 2009, the four active instruments have been ACS, COS, STIS and WFC3. NICMOS is kept in hibernation, but may be revived if WFC3 were to fail in the future. Of the former instruments, three (COSTAR, FOS and WFPC2) are displayed in the SmithsonianNational Air and Space Museum.The FOC is in theDorniermuseum, Germany.The HSP is in the Space Place at theUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison.The first WFPC was dismantled, and some components were then re-used in WFC3. Within weeks of the launch of the telescope, the returned images indicated a serious problem with the optical system. Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images ofpoint sourcesspread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond, instead of having apoint spread function(PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1arcseconds(485nrad) in diameter, as had been specified in the design criteria. Analysis of the flawed images revealed that the primary mirror had been polished to the wrong shape. Although it was believed to be one of the most preciselyfiguredoptical mirrors ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers,the outer perimeter was too flat by about 2200 nanometers (about1⁄450mm or1⁄11000inch).This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirrorfocuseson a different point from the light reflecting off its center. The effect of the mirror flaw on scientific observations depended on the particular observation. The core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was affected only through a sensitivity loss; however, the loss of light to the large, out-of-focus halo severely reduced the usefulness of the telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant nearly all the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects.This led politicians to question NASA's competence, scientists to rue the cost which could have gone to more productive endeavors, and comedians to make jokes about NASA and the telescope. In the 1991 comedyThe Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear, in a scene where historical disasters are displayed, Hubble is pictured with theTitanicand theHindenburg.Nonetheless, during the first three years of the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets.The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticatedimage processingtechniques such asdeconvolution. A commission headed byLew Allen, director of theJet Propulsion Laboratory, was established to determine how the error could have arisen. The Allen Commission found that a reflectivenull corrector, a testing device used to achieve a properly shaped non-spherical mirror, had been incorrectly assembled. (One lens was out of position by 1.3 mm (0.051 in).)During the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror,Perkin-Elmeranalyzed its surface with two conventional refractive null correctors. However, for the final manufacturing step (figuring), they switched to the custom-built reflective null corrector, designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances. The incorrect assembly of this device resulted in the mirror being ground very precisely but to the wrong shape. During fabrication, a few tests using conventional null correctors correctly reportedspherical aberration. But these results were dismissed, thus missing the opportunity to catch the error, because the reflective null corrector was considered more accurate. The commission blamed the failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument. Many feared that Hubble would be abandoned.The design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions, and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem that could be applied at the first servicing mission, scheduled for 1993. While Kodak had ground a back-up mirror for Hubble, it would have been impossible to replace the mirror in orbit, and too expensive and time-consuming to bring the telescope back to Earth for a refit. Instead, the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense, to be added to the telescope at the servicing mission, effectively acting as "spectacles" to correct the spherical aberration. The first step was a precise characterization of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that theconic constantof the mirror as built was−1.01390±0.0002, instead of the intended−1.00230.The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the mirror, as well as by analyzinginterferogramsobtained during ground testing of the mirror. Because of the way the HST's instruments were designed, two different sets of correctors were required. The design of the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, already planned to replace the existing WF/PC, included relay mirrors to direct light onto the four separate charge-coupled device (CCD) chips making up its two cameras. An inverse error built into their surfaces could completely cancel the aberration of the primary. However, the other instruments lacked any intermediate surfaces that could be configured in this way, and so required an external correction device. TheCorrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement(COSTAR) system was designed to correct the spherical aberration for light focused at the FOC, FOS, and GHRS. It consists of two mirrors in the light path with one ground to correct the aberration.To fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope, one of the other instruments had to be removed, and astronomers selected the High Speed Photometer to be sacrificed.By 2002, all the original instruments requiring COSTAR had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective optics.COSTAR was then removed and returned to Earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.The area previously used by COSTAR is now occupied by theCosmic Origins Spectrograph. Hubble was designed to accommodate regular servicing and equipment upgrades while in orbit. Instruments and limited life items were designed asorbital replacement units.Five servicing missions (SM 1, 2, 3A, 3B, and 4) were flown by NASASpace Shuttles, the first in December 1993 and the last in May 2009.Servicing missions were delicate operations that began with maneuvering to intercept the telescope in orbit and carefully retrieving it with the shuttle'smechanical arm. The necessary work was then carried out in multiple tetheredspacewalksover a period of four to five days. After a visual inspection of the telescope, astronauts conducted repairs, replaced failed or degraded components, upgraded equipment, and installed new instruments. Once work was completed, the telescope was redeployed, typically after boosting to a higher orbit to address theorbital decaycaused by atmosphericdrag. The first Hubble servicing mission was scheduled for 1993 before the mirror problem was discovered. It assumed greater importance, as the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics; failure would have resulted in either abandoning Hubble or accepting its permanent disability. Other components failed before the mission, causing the repair cost to rise to $500million (not including the cost of the shuttle flight). A successful repair would help demonstrate the viability of buildingSpace Station Alpha. STS-49in 1992 demonstrated the difficulty of space work. While its rescue ofIntelsat 603received praise, the astronauts had taken possibly reckless risks in doing so. Neither the rescue nor the unrelated assembly of prototype space station components occurred as the astronauts had trained, causing NASA to reassess planning and training, including for the Hubble repair. The agency assigned to the missionStory Musgrave(who had worked on satellite repair procedures since 1976) and six other experienced astronauts, including two from STS-49. The first mission director sinceProject Apollo[clarification needed]would coordinate a crew with 16 previous shuttle flights. The astronauts were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools. Heat had been the problem on prior spacewalks, which occurred in sunlight. Hubble needed to be repaired out of sunlight. Musgrave discovered during vacuum training, seven months before the mission, that spacesuit gloves did not sufficiently protect against the cold of space. AfterSTS-57confirmed the issue in orbit, NASA quickly changed equipment, procedures, and flight plan. Seven total mission simulations occurred before launch, the most thorough preparation in shuttle history. No complete Hubble mockup existed, so the astronauts studied many separate models (including one at the Smithsonian) and mentally combined their varying and contradictory details. Service Mission 1 flew aboardEndeavourin December 1993, and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over ten days. Most importantly, theHigh Speed Photometerwas replaced with theCOSTARcorrective optics package, and WF/PC was replaced with theWide Field and Planetary Camera 2(WFPC2) with an internal optical correction system. Thesolar arraysand their drive electronics were also replaced, as well as four gyroscopes in the telescope pointing system, two electrical control units and other electrical components, and two magnetometers. The onboard computers were upgraded with addedcoprocessors, and Hubble's orbit was boosted. On January 13, 1994, NASA declared the mission a complete success and showed the first sharper images.The mission was one of the most complex performed to that date, involving five longextra-vehicular activityperiods. Its success was a boon for NASA, as well as for the astronomers who now had a more capable space telescope. Servicing Mission 2, flown byDiscoveryin February 1997, replaced the GHRS and the FOS with theSpace Telescope Imaging Spectrograph(STIS) and theNear Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer(NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with a new Solid State Recorder, and repaired thermal insulation.NICMOS contained aheat sinkof solidnitrogento reduce thethermal noisefrom the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpectedthermal expansionresulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about two years. Servicing Mission 3A, flown byDiscovery, took place in December 1999, and was a split-off from Servicing Mission3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed. The fourth failed a few weeks before the mission, rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations. The mission replaced all sixgyroscopes, replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery overcharging, and replaced thermal insulation blankets. Servicing Mission 3B flown byColumbiain March 2002 saw the installation of a new instrument, with the FOC (which, except for the Fine Guidance Sensors when used for astrometry, was the last of the original instruments) being replaced by theAdvanced Camera for Surveys(ACS). This meant COSTAR was no longer required, since all new instruments had built-in correction for the main mirror aberration.The mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed-cycle coolerand replaced the solar arrays for the second time, providing 30 percent more power. Plans called for Hubble to be serviced in February 2005, but theColumbiadisasterin 2003, in which the orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects to the Hubble program and other NASA missions. NASA AdministratorSean O'Keefedecided all future shuttle missions had to be able to reach the safe haven of theInternational Space Stationshould in-flight problems develop. As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the space station during the same mission, future crewed service missions were canceled.This decision was criticized by numerous astronomers who felt Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk.HST's planned successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), by 2004 was not expected to launch until at least 2011. JWST was eventually launched in December 2021.A gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST.The consideration that JWST will not be located in low Earth orbit, and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure, only made concerns more acute. On the other hand, NASA officials were concerned that continuing to service Hubble would consume funds from other programs and delay the JWST. In January 2004, O'Keefe said he would review his decision to cancel the final servicing mission to HST, due to public outcry and requests from Congress for NASA to look for a way to save it. The National Academy of Sciences convened an official panel, which recommended in July 2004 that the HST should be preserved despite the apparent risks. Their report urged "NASA should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope".In August 2004, O'Keefe asked Goddard Space Flight Center to prepare a detailed proposal for a robotic service mission. These plans were later canceled, the robotic mission being described as "not feasible".In late 2004, several Congressional members, led by SenatorBarbara Mikulski, held public hearings and carried on a fight with much public support (including thousands of letters from school children across the U.S.) to get the Bush Administration and NASA to reconsider the decision to drop plans for a Hubble rescue mission. The nomination in April 2005 of a new NASA Administrator,Michael D. Griffin, changed the situation, as Griffin stated he would consider a crewed servicing mission.Soon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a crewed Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions. In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission byAtlantiswas scheduled for October 2008. Hubble's main data-handling unit failed in September 2008,halting all reporting of scientific data until its back-up was brought online on October 25, 2008.Since a failure of the backup unit would leave the HST helpless, the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit. Servicing Mission 4 (SM4), flown byAtlantisin May 2009, was the last scheduled shuttle mission for HST.SM4 installed the replacement data-handling unit, repaired the ACS and STIS systems, installed improvednickel–hydrogen batteries, and replaced other components including all six gyroscopes. SM4 also installed two new observation instruments: Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and theCosmic Origins Spectrograph(COS)and theSoft Capture and Rendezvous System, which will enable the future rendezvous, capture, and safe disposal of Hubble by either a crewed or robotic mission.Except for the ACS'sHigh Resolution Channel, which could not be repaired and was disabled,the work accomplished during SM4 rendered the telescope fully functional. Since the start of the program, a number of research projects have been carried out, some of them almost solely with Hubble, others coordinated facilities such asChandra X-ray ObservatoryandESO'sVery Large Telescope. Although the Hubble observatory is nearing the end of its life, there are still major projects scheduled for it. One example is the current (2022) ULLYSES project (Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards) which will last for three years to observe a set of high- and low-mass young stars and will shed light on star formation and composition. Another is the OPAL project (Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy), which is focussed on understanding the evolution and dynamics of the atmosphere of the outer planets (such as Jupiter and Uranus) by making baseline observations over an extended period. In an August 2013 press release,CANDELSwas referred to as "the largest project in the history of Hubble". The survey "aims to explore galactic evolution in the early Universe, and the first seeds of cosmic structure at less than one billion years after the Big Bang."The CANDELS project site describes the survey's goals as the following: The Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution from z = 8 to 1.5 via deep imaging of more than 250,000 galaxies with WFC3/IR and ACS. It will also find the first Type Ia SNe beyond z > 1.5 and establish their accuracy as standard candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected; each has multi-wavelength data from Spitzer and other facilities, and has extensive spectroscopy of the brighter galaxies. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to 109solar masses out to z ~ 8. The program, officially named "Hubble Deep Fields Initiative 2012", is aimed to advance the knowledge of earlygalaxy formationby studying high-redshift galaxies inblank fieldswith the help ofgravitational lensingto see the "faintest galaxies in the distant universe".The Frontier Fields web page describes the goals of the program being: TheCosmic Evolution Survey(COSMOS)is an astronomical survey designed to probe the formation and evolution of galaxies as a function of both cosmic time (redshift) and the local galaxy environment. The survey covers a two square degree equatorial field with spectroscopy and X-ray to radio imaging by most of the major space-based telescopes and a number of large ground based telescopes,making it a key focus region of extragalactic astrophysics. COSMOS was launched in 2006 as the largest project pursued by the Hubble Space Telescope at the time, and still is the largest continuous area of sky covered for the purposes of mapping deep space inblank fields, 2.5 times the area of the moon on the sky and 17 times larger than the largest of the CANDELS regions. The COSMOS scientific collaboration that was forged from the initial COSMOS survey is the largest and longest-running extragalactic collaboration, known for its collegiality and openness. The study of galaxies in their environment can be done only with large areas of the sky, larger than a half square degree.More than two million galaxies are detected, spanning 90% of the age of theUniverse. The COSMOS collaboration is led byCaitlin Casey,Jeyhan Kartaltepe, and Vernesa Smolcic and involves more than 200 scientists in a dozen countries. TheCluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble(CLASH) was a Treasury Program from 2010 to 2013 conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope to observe 25 massive galaxy clusters by using gravitational lensing. CLASH aimed to examine the distribution of dark matter and dark energy in massive galaxy clusters with the new instruments installed in 2009. Imagery showing the effects of gravitational lensing is one means of detecting dark matter and dark energy, and CLASH focused on trying to gain a better understanding of both mysterious topics. ThePanchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury and Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury(PHAT and PHAST) were observations done by Hubble from July 2010 to October 2013 to map the northern half of theAndromeda Galaxyand from December 2021 to January 2024 to map the southern half. Andromeda is the nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way Galaxy and Hubble created the highest resolution and most detailedphotomosaicever of Andromeda. Two hundred million stars can be seen in this combined image of both Treasury Programs out of a total one trillion stars in Andromeda. Each star looks like a grain of sand. The northern half, PHAT, was mapped in near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelengths in 828 orbits and was released in January 2015. The southern half, PHAST, was mapped in near-ultraviolet and visible wavelengths in 195 orbits and was released in January 2025. Observing Andromeda in this detail is the best alternative to observing the Milky Way Galaxy because Earth is within the Milky Way and cannot observe most of the Milky Way due to thegalaxy itself blocking observationsof 20% of the sky and most of the galaxy. To achieve this mosaic 1,023 Hubble orbits were needed. The mosaic image is made up of at least 2.5billion pixels. Anyone can apply for time on the telescope; there are no restrictions on nationality or academic affiliation, but funding for analysis is available only to U.S. institutions.Competition for time on the telescope is intense, with about one-fifth of the proposals submitted in each cycle earning time on the schedule. Calls for proposals are issued roughly annually, with time allocated for a cycle lasting about one year. Proposals are divided into several categories; "general observer" proposals are the most common, covering routine observations. "Snapshot observations" are those in which targets require only 45 minutes or less of telescope time, including overheads such as acquiring the target. Snapshot observations are used to fill in gaps in the telescope schedule that cannot be filled by regular general observer programs. Astronomers may make "Target of Opportunity" proposals, in which observations are scheduled if a transient event covered by the proposal occurs during the scheduling cycle. In addition, up to 10% of the telescope time is designated "director's discretionary" (DD) time. Astronomers can apply to use DD time at any time of year, and it is typically awarded for study of unexpected transient phenomena such as supernovae. Other uses of DD time have included the observations that led to views of the Hubble Deep Field and Hubble Ultra Deep Field, and in the first four cycles of telescope time, observations that were carried out by amateur astronomers. In 2012, the ESA held a contest for public image processing of Hubble data to encourage the discovery of "hidden treasures" in the raw Hubble data. The first director of STScI,Riccardo Giacconi, announced in 1986 that he intended to devote some of his director discretionary time to allowing amateur astronomers to use the telescope. The total time to be allocated was only a few hours per cycle but excited great interest among amateur astronomers. Proposals for amateur time were stringently reviewed by a committee of amateur astronomers, and time was awarded only to proposals that were deemed to have genuine scientific merit, did not duplicate proposals made by professionals, and required the unique capabilities of the space telescope. Thirteen amateur astronomers were awarded time on the telescope, with observations being carried out between 1990 and 1997.One such study was "Transition Comets – UV Search for OH". The first proposal, "A Hubble Space Telescope Study of Posteclipse Brightening and Albedo Changes on Io", was published inIcarus,a journal devoted to solar system studies. A second study from another group of amateurs was also published inIcarus.After that time, however, budget reductions at STScI made the support of work by amateur astronomers untenable, and no additional amateur programs have been carried out. Regular Hubble proposals still include findings or discovered objects by amateurs andcitizen scientists. These observations are often in a collaboration with professional astronomers. One of the earliest such observations is theGreat White Spotof 1990on planet Saturn, discovered by amateur astronomer S. Wilberand observed by HST under a proposal by J. Westphal (Caltech).Later professional-amateur observations by Hubble include discoveries by theGalaxy Zooproject, such asVoorwerpjesandGreen Pea galaxies.The "Gems of the Galaxies" program is based on a list of objects byGalaxy Zoovolunteers that was shortened with the help of an online vote.Additionally there are observations ofminor planetsdiscovered by amateur astronomers, such as2I/Borisovand changes in the atmosphere of thegas giantsJupiter and Saturn or theice giantsUranus and Neptune.In the pro-am collaborationbackyard worldsthe HST was used to observe aplanetary mass object, calledWISE J0830+2837. The non-detection by the HST helped to classify this peculiar object. In the early 1980s, NASA and STScI convened four panels to discuss key projects. These were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time, which would be explicitly dedicated to each project. This guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early, in case the telescope failed sooner than expected. The panels identified three such projects: 1) a study of the nearby intergalactic medium using quasarabsorption linesto determine the properties of theintergalactic mediumand the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies;2) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being usedand 3) a project to determine theHubble constantwithin ten percent by reducing the errors, both external and internal, in the calibration of the distance scale. Hubble has helped resolve some long-standing problems in astronomy, while also raising new questions. Some results have required newtheoriesto explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances toCepheid variablestars more accurately than ever before, and thusconstrain the valueof theHubble constant, the measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically haderrorsof up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in theVirgo Clusterand other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques.The estimated age of the universe is now 13.7billion years. (Before the Hubble Telescope it was ten to twenty billion.) Astronomers from theHigh-z Supernova Search Teamand theSupernova Cosmology Projectused ground-based telescopes and HST to observe distantsupernovaeand uncovered evidence that, far from decelerating under the influence ofgravity, the expansion of the universe is insteadaccelerating. Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awardedNobel Prizesfor their discovery.The cause of this acceleration remains poorly understood;the term used for the currently-unknown cause isdark energy, signifying that it is dark (unable to be directly seen and detected) to our current scientific instruments. The high-resolution spectra and images provided by the HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence ofblack holesin the center of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would be found at the centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies.The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. A unique window on the Universe enabled by Hubble are theHubble Deep Field,Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, andHubble Extreme Deep Fieldimages, which used Hubble's unmatched sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths. The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, thereby providing information about the early Universe, and have accordingly generated a wealth of scientific papers. The Wide Field Camera3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery of some of the most distant objects yet discovered, such asMACS0647-JD. The non-standard objectSCP 06F6was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in February 2006. On March 3, 2016, researchers using Hubble data announced the discovery of the farthest confirmed galaxy to date:GN-z11, which Hubble observed as it existed roughly 400million years after the Big Bang.The Hubble observations occurred on February 11, 2015, and April 3, 2015, as part of theCANDELS/GOODS-North surveys. The collision ofComet Shoemaker-Levy 9withJupiterin 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers, coming just a few months after Servicing Mission1 had restored Hubble's optical performance. Hubble images of theplanetwere sharper than any taken since the passage ofVoyager 2in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the collision of a large comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries. In March 2015, researchers announced that measurements of aurorae aroundGanymede, one of Jupiter's moons, revealed that it has a subsurface ocean. Using Hubble to study the motion of its aurorae, the researchers determined that a large saltwater ocean was helping to suppress the interaction between Jupiter's magnetic field and that of Ganymede. The ocean is estimated to be 100 km (60 mi) deep, trapped beneath a 150 km (90 mi) ice crust. HST has also been used to study objects in the outer reaches of the Solar System, including the dwarf planetsPluto,Eris,andSedna.During June and July 2012, U.S. astronomers using Hubble discoveredStyx, a tiny fifth moon orbiting Pluto. From June to August 2015, Hubble was used tosearchfor aKuiper beltobject (KBO) target for theNew HorizonsKuiper Belt Extended Mission (KEM) when similar searches with ground telescopes failed to find a suitable target.This resulted in the discovery of at least five new KBOs, including the eventual KEM target,486958 Arrokoth, thatNew Horizonsperformed a close fly-by of on January 1, 2019. In April 2022 NASA announced that astronomers were able to use images from HST to determine the size of the nucleus of cometC/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli–Bernstein), which is the largest icy comet nucleus ever seen by astronomers. The nucleus of C/2014 UN271 has an estimated mass of fifty trillion tons which is fifty times the mass of other known comets in the Solar System. On December 11, 2015, Hubble captured an image of the first-ever predicted reappearance of a supernova, dubbed "Refsdal", which was calculated using different mass models of a galaxy cluster whose gravity iswarpingthe supernova's light. The supernova was previously seen in November 2014 behind galaxy clusterMACS J1149.5+2223as part of Hubble's Frontier Fields program. The light from the cluster took roughly five billion years to reach Earth, while the light from the supernova behind it took five billion more years than that, as measured by their respectiveredshifts. Because of the gravitational effect of the galaxy cluster, four images of the supernova appeared instead of one, an example of anEinstein cross. Based on early lens models, a fifth image was predicted to reappear by the end of 2015.Refsdal reappeared as predicted in 2015. In March 2019, observations from Hubble and data from the European Space Agency'sGaiaspace observatory were combined to determine that the mass of theMilky Way Galaxyis approximately 1.5trillion times the mass of the Sun, a value intermediate between prior estimates. Other discoveries made with Hubble data include proto-planetary disks (proplyds) in theOrion Nebula;evidence for the presence ofextrasolar planetsaround Sun-like stars;and the optical counterparts of the still-mysteriousgamma-ray bursts.Usinggravitational lensing, Hubble observed a galaxy designatedMACS 2129-1approximately ten billion lightyears from Earth. MACS 2129-1 subverted expectations about galaxies in which new star formation had ceased, a significant result for understanding the formation ofelliptical galaxies. In 2022 Hubble detected the light of the farthest individual star ever seen to date. The star,WHL0137-LS(nicknamedEarendel), existed within the first billion years after theBig Bang. It will be observed by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to confirm Earendel is indeed a star. Many objective measures show the positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy. As of 2025, over 22,000papersbased on Hubble data have been published in peer-reviewed journals,and countless more have appeared in conferenceproceedings. Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have nocitations, while only two percent of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data. Although the HST has clearly helped astronomical research, its financial cost has been large. A study on the relative astronomical benefits of different sizes of telescopes found that while papers based on HST data generate 15 times as many citations as a 4 m (13 ft) ground-based telescope such as theWilliam Herschel Telescope, the HST costs about 100 times as much to build and maintain. Deciding between building ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based techniques such asaperture masking interferometryhad obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble.Since then, advances inadaptive opticshave extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can correct only a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wider field.Moreover, Hubble can image more faint objects, since ground-based telescopes are affected by the background of scattered light created by the Earth's atmosphere. In addition to its scientific results, Hubble has also made significant contributions toaerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit (LEO). These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior ofgraphite compositestructures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing,radiation damageto electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior ofmulti-layer insulation.One lesson learned was that gyroscopes assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyroscopes are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.Another is that optical surfaces in LEO can have surprisingly long lifetimes; Hubble was only expected to last 15 years before the mirror became unusable, but after 14 years there was no measureable degradation.Finally, Hubble servicing missions, particularly those that serviced components not designed for in-space maintenance, have contributed towards the development of new tools and techniques for on-orbit repair. Hubble data was initially stored on the spacecraft. When launched, the storage facilities were old-fashioned reel-to-reeltape drives, but these were replaced bysolid statedata storage facilities during servicing missions2 and 3A. About twice daily, the Hubble Space Telescope radios data to a satellite in thegeosynchronousTracking and Data Relay Satellite System(TDRSS), which then downlinks the science data to one of two 60-foot (18-meter) diameter high-gain microwave antennas located at theWhite Sands Test FacilityinWhite Sands, New Mexico.From there they are sent to the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center, and finally to the Space Telescope Science Institute for archiving.Each week, HST downlinks approximately 140 gigabits of data. All images from Hubble aremonochromaticgrayscale, taken through a variety of filters, each passing specific wavelengths of light, and incorporated in each camera. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also createfalse-colorversions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue. All Hubble data is eventually made available via theMikulski Archive for Space TelescopesatSTScI,CADCandESA/ESAC.Data is usually proprietary (available only to theprincipal investigator(PI) and astronomers designated by the PI) for twelve months after being taken. The PI can apply to the director of the STScI to extend or reduce the proprietary period in some circumstances. Observations made on Director's Discretionary Time are exempt from the proprietary period, and are released to the public immediately. Calibration data such as flat fields anddark framesare also publicly available straight away. All data in the archive is in theFITSformat, which is suitable for astronomical analysis but not for public use.TheHubble Heritage Projectprocesses and releases to the public a small selection of the most striking images inJPEGandTIFFformats. Astronomical data taken with CCDs must undergo several calibration steps before they are suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This "on-the-fly" processing means large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as "pipeline reduction", and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used. Hubble data can be analyzed using many different packages. STScI maintains the custom-madeSpace Telescope Science Data Analysis System(STSDAS) software, which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files, as well as many other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data. The software runs as a module ofIRAF, a popular astronomical data reduction program. NASA considered it important for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution oftaxpayersto its construction and operational costs.After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images. Several initiatives have helped to keep the public informed about Hubble activities.
In the United States,outreachefforts are coordinated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Office for Public Outreach, which was established in 2000 to ensure that U.S. taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program. To that end, STScI operates the HubbleSite.org website. TheHubble Heritage Project, operating out of the STScI, provides the public with high-quality images of the most interesting and striking objects observed. The Heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers, as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy, and emphasizes theaestheticnature of Hubble images. The Heritage Project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which, for scientific reasons, may not have images taken at enough wavelengths to construct a full-color image. Since 1999, the leading Hubble outreach group in Europe has been theHubble European Space Agency Information Centre(HEIC).This office was established at theSpace Telescope European Coordinating Facilityin Munich, Germany. HEIC's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency. The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. ESA produces educational material, including avideocastseries called Hubblecast designed to share world-class scientific news with the public. The Hubble Space Telescope has won two Space Achievement Awards from theSpace Foundation, for its outreach activities, in 2001 and 2010. A replica of the Hubble Space Telescope is displayed on the courthouse lawn inMarshfield, Missouri, the hometown of namesake Edwin P. Hubble. The Hubble Space Telescope celebrated its 20th anniversary in space on April 24, 2010. To commemorate the occasion, NASA, ESA, and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) released an image from theCarina Nebula. To commemorate Hubble's 25th anniversary in space on April 24, 2015, STScI released images of theWesterlund 2cluster, located about 20,000 light-years (6,100 pc) away in the constellation Carina, through its Hubble 25 website.The European Space Agency created a dedicated 25th anniversary page on its website.In April 2016, a special celebratory image of theBubble Nebulawas released for Hubble's 26th "birthday". HST uses gyroscopes to detect and measure any rotations so it can stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets. HST has six of these rate-sensing gyroscopes installed. Three gyroscopes are normally required for operation; observations are still possible with two or one, but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted, and observations requiring very accurate pointing are more difficult.In 2018, the plan was to drop into one-gyroscope mode if fewer than three working gyroscopes were operational. The gyroscopes are part of thePointing Control System, which uses five types of sensors (magnetic sensors, optical sensors, and the gyroscopes) and two types ofactuators(reaction wheelsandmagnetic torquers). After theColumbiadisasterin 2003, it was unclear whether another servicing mission would be possible, and gyroscope life became a concern again, so engineers developed new software for two-gyroscope and one-gyroscope modes to maximize the potential lifetime. The development was successful, and in 2005, it was decided to switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission. The switch to this mode was made in August 2005, leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use, two on backup, and two inoperable.One more gyroscope failed in 2007. By the time of the final repair mission in May 2009, during which all six gyroscopes were replaced (with two new pairs and one refurbished pair), only three were still working. Engineers determined that the gyroscope failures were caused by corrosion of electric wires powering the motor that was initiated by oxygen-pressurized air used to deliver the thick suspending fluid.The new gyroscope models were assembled using pressurized nitrogenand were expected to be much more reliable.In the 2009 servicing mission all six gyroscopes were replaced, and after almost ten years only three gyroscopes failed, and only after exceeding the average expected run time for the design. Of the six gyroscopes replaced in 2009, three were of the old design susceptible for flex-lead failure, and three were of the new design with a longer expected lifetime. The first of the old-style gyroscopes failed in March 2014, and the second in April 2018. On October 5, 2018, the last of the old-style gyroscopes failed, and one of the new-style gyroscopes was powered-up from standby state. However, that reserve gyroscope did not immediately perform within operational limits, and so the observatory was placed into "safe" mode while scientists attempted to fix the problem.NASA tweeted on October 22, 2018, that the "rotation rates produced by the backup gyro have reduced and are now within a normal range. Additional tests [are] to be performed to ensure Hubble can return to science operations with this gyro." The solution that restored the backup new-style gyroscope to operational range was widely reported as "turning it off and on again".A "running restart" of the gyroscope was performed, but this had no effect, and the final resolution to the failure was more complex. The failure was attributed to an inconsistency in the fluid surrounding the float within the gyroscope, i.e. an air bubble. On October 18, 2018, the Hubble Operations Team directed the spacecraft into a series of maneuvers, moving it in opposite directions in order to mitigate the inconsistency. Only after the maneuvers, and a subsequent set of maneuvers on October 19, did the gyroscope truly operate within its normal range. Past servicing missions have exchanged old instruments for new ones, avoiding failure and making new types of science possible. Without servicing missions, all the instruments will eventually fail. In August 2004, the power system of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The electronics had originally been fully redundant, but the first set of electronics failed in May 2001.This power supply was fixed during Servicing Mission4 in May 2009. Similarly, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) main camera primary electronics failed in June 2006, and the power supply for the backup electronics failed on January 27, 2007.Only the instrument's Solar Blind Channel (SBC) was operable using the side-1 electronics. A new power supply for the wide angle channel was added during SM 4, but quick tests revealed this did not help the high resolution channel.The Wide Field Channel (WFC) was returned to service by STS-125 in May 2009 but the High Resolution Channel (HRC) remains offline. On January 8, 2019, Hubble entered a partial safe mode following suspected hardware problems in its most advanced instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument. NASA later reported that the cause of the safe mode within the instrument was a detection of voltage levels out of a defined range. On January 15, 2019, NASA said the cause of the failure was a software problem. Engineering data within the telemetry circuits were not accurate. In addition, all other telemetry within those circuits also contained erroneous values indicating that this was a telemetry issue and not a power supply issue. After resetting the telemetry circuits and associated boards the instrument began functioning again. On January 17, 2019, the device was returned to normal operation and on the same day it completed its first science observations. On June 13, 2021, Hubble's payload computer halted due to a suspected issue with a memory module. An attempt to restart the computer on June 14 failed. Further attempts to switch to one of three other backup memory modules on board the spacecraft failed on June 18. On June 23 and 24, NASA engineers switched Hubble to a backup payload computer, but these operations have failed as well with the same error. On June 28, 2021, NASA announced that it was extending the investigation to other components.Scientific operations were suspended while NASA worked to diagnose and resolve the issue.After identifying a malfunctioning power control unit (PCU) supplying power to one of Hubble's computers, NASA was able to switch to a backup PCU and bring Hubble back to operational mode on July 16.On October 23, 2021, HST instruments reported missing synchronization messagesand went into safe mode.By December 8, 2021, NASA had restored full science operations and was developing updates to make instruments more resilient to missing synchronization messages. Hubble orbits the Earth in the extremely tenuous upperatmosphere, and over time its orbitdecaysdue todrag. If notreboosted, it will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere within some decades, with the exact date depending on how active the Sun is and its impact on the upper atmosphere. If Hubble were to descend in a completely uncontrolled re-entry, parts of the main mirror and its support structure would probably survive, leaving the potential for damage or even human fatalities.In 2013, deputy project manager James Jeletic projected that Hubble could survive into the 2020s.Based on solar activity and atmospheric drag, or lack thereof, a natural atmospheric reentry for Hubble will occur between 2028 and 2040.In June 2016, NASA extended the service contract for Hubble until June 2021.In November 2021, NASA extended the service contract for Hubble until June 2026. NASA's original plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was toretrieve it using a Space Shuttle. Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in theSmithsonian Institution. This is no longer possible since theSpace Shuttle fleet has been retired, and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and risk to the crew. Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry.Ultimately, in 2009, as part of Servicing Mission 4, the last servicing mission by the Space Shuttle, NASA installed the Soft Capture Mechanism (SCM), to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission. The SCM, together with the Relative Navigation System (RNS), mounted on the Shuttle to collect data to "enable NASA to pursue numerous options for the safe de-orbit of Hubble", constitute the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System (SCRS). As of 2017[update], theTrump Administrationwas considering a proposal by theSierra Nevada Corporationto use a crewed version of itsDream Chaserspacecraft to serviceHubblesome time in the 2020s as a continuation of its scientific capabilities and as insurance against any malfunctions in the James Webb Space Telescope.In 2020,John Grunsfeldsaid thatSpaceX Crew DragonorOrioncould perform another repair mission within ten years. While robotic technology is not yet sophisticated enough, he said, with another crewed visit "We could keep Hubble going for another few decades" with new gyros and instruments. Billionaireprivate astronautJared Isaacmanproposed to fund a servicing mission using SpaceX spacecraft. Though it might save NASA much money, SpaceX and NASA differed on the mission's risk.In September 2022, NASA and SpaceX signed a Space Act Agreement to investigate the possibility of launching a Crew Dragon mission to service and boost Hubble to a higher orbit, possibly extending its lifespan by another 20 years.This mission could have been the second of thePolaris Program, but by June 2024 NASA had rejected a private servicing mission because of potential damage to the observatory. There is no direct replacement to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes do not duplicate Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the further infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying the expense of a space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by usingadaptive optics(AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space. Plans for a Hubble successor materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which culminated in plans for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble.Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, it is designed to operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft.A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in theearly Universeapproximately 280million years older than stars HST now detects.The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and theCanadian Space Agencysince 1996,and was launched on December 25, 2021, on anAriane 5rocket.Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light. A complementary telescope, looking at even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency'sHerschel Space Observatory, launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel was not designed to be serviced after launch, and had a mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in thefar infraredandsubmillimeter. It needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013. Further concepts for advanced 21st-century space telescopes include theLarge Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor(LUVOIR),a conceptualized 8 to 16.8 meters (310 to 660 inches) optical space telescope that if realized could be a more direct successor to HST, with the ability to observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the Spitzer Space Telescope. The final planning report, prepared for the 2020Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey, suggested a launch date of 2039.The Decadal Survey eventually recommended that ideas for LUVOIR be combined with theHabitable Exoplanet Observerproposal to devise a new, 6-meter flagship telescope that could launch in the 2040s. Existing ground-based telescopes, and various proposedExtremely Large Telescopes, can exceed the HST in terms of sheer light-gathering power and diffraction limit due to larger mirrors, but other factors affect telescopes. In some cases, they may be able to match or exceed Hubble in resolution by using adaptive optics (AO). However, AO on large ground-based reflectors will not make Hubble and other space telescopes obsolete. Most AO systems sharpen the view over a very narrow field:Lucky Cam, for example, produces crisp images just 10 to 20 arcseconds wide, whereas Hubble's cameras produce crisp images across a 150-arcsecond (2½ arcminutes) field. Furthermore, space telescopes can study the universe across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, most of which is blocked by Earth's atmosphere. Finally, the background sky is darker in space than on the ground, because air absorbs solar energy during the day and then releases it at night, producing a faint but discernibleairglowthat washes out low-contrast astronomical objects.

AMars roveris a remote-controlledmotor vehicledesigned to travel on the surface ofMars.Rovershave several advantages over stationarylanders: they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remoteroboticvehicle control. They serve a different purpose than orbital spacecraft likeMars Reconnaissance Orbiter. A more recent development is theMars helicopter. As of May 2021[update], there have been six successful robotically operated Mars rovers; the first five, managed by the AmericanNASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, were (by date of Mars landing):Sojourner(1997),Spirit(2004–2010),Opportunity(2004–2018),Curiosity(2012–present), andPerseverance(2021–present). The sixth, managed by theChina National Space Administration, isZhurong(2021–2022). On January 24, 2016,NASAreported thatongoing studieson Mars byOpportunityandCuriositywould be searching for evidence of ancient life, including abiospherebased onautotrophic,chemotrophicorchemolithoautotrophicmicroorganisms, as well as ancient water, includingfluvio-lacustrine environments(plainsrelated to ancientriversorlakes) that may have beenhabitable.The search for evidence ofhabitability,taphonomy(related tofossils), andorganic carbonon Mars has become a primary NASA objective. The Soviet probes,Mars 2andMars 3, were physically tethered probes;Sojournerwas dependent on theMars Pathfinderbase station for communication with Earth;Opportunity,SpiritandCuriositywere on their own. As of April 27, 2025,Curiosityis still active, whileSpirit,Opportunity, andSojournercompleted their missions before losing contact. On February 18, 2021,Perseverance, the newest American Mars rover, successfully landed.  On May 14, 2021, China'sZhurongbecame the first non-American rover to successfully operate on Mars. Examples of instruments onboard landed rovers include: Circa the 2010s, NASA had established certain goals for the rover program. NASA distinguishes between "mission" objectives and "science" objectives. Mission objectives are related to progress inspace technologyand development processes. Science objectives are met by the instruments during their mission in space. The science instruments are chosen and designed based on the science objectives and goals. The primary goal of theSpiritandOpportunityrovers was to investigate "the history of water on Mars". The four science goals of NASA's long-termMars Exploration Programare:

TheInternational Space Station(ISS) is a largespace stationthat wasassembledand is maintained inlow Earth orbitby a collaboration of five space agencies and their contractors:NASA(United States),Roscosmos(Russia),ESA(Europe),JAXA(Japan), andCSA(Canada). As the largest space station ever constructed, it primarily serves as a platform for conducting scientific experiments inmicrogravityand studying thespace environment. The station is divided into two main sections: theRussian Orbital Segment(ROS), developed by Roscosmos, and theUS Orbital Segment(USOS), built by NASA, ESA, JAXA, and CSA. A striking feature of the ISS is theIntegrated Truss Structure, which connect the station's vast system ofsolar panelsandradiatorsto its pressurized modules. These modules support diverse functions, including scientific research, crew habitation, storage, spacecraft control, and airlock operations. The ISS has eightdocking and berthing portsfor visiting spacecraft. The station orbits the Earth at an average altitude of 400 kilometres (250 miles)and circles the Earth in roughly 93 minutes, completing 15.5 orbits per day. TheISS programmecombines two previously planned crewed Earth-orbiting stations: the United States'Space StationFreedomand the Soviet Union'sMir-2. Thefirst ISS modulewas launched in 1998, with major components delivered byProtonandSoyuzrockets and theSpace Shuttle. Long-term occupancy began on 2 November 2000, with the arrival of theExpedition 1crew. Since then, the ISS has remained continuously inhabited for 24 years and 359 days, the longest continuous human presence in space. As of August 2025[update], 290 individuals from 26 countries had visited the station. Future plans for the ISS include the addition of at least one module,Axiom Space'sPayload Power Thermal Module. The station is expected to remain operational until the end of 2030, after which it will be de-orbited using theUS Deorbit Vehicle. As thespace racedrew to a close in the early 1970s, the US andUSSRbegan to contemplate a variety of potential collaborations in outer space. This culminated in the 1975Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first docking of spacecraft from two different spacefaring nations. The ASTP was considered a success, and further joint missions were also contemplated. One such concept was International Skylab, which proposed launching the backupSkylab Bspace station for a mission that would see multiple visits by bothApolloandSoyuzcrew vehicles.More ambitious was the Skylab-Salyut Space Laboratory, which proposed docking the Skylab B to a SovietSalyutspace station. Falling budgets and risingCold Wartensions in the late 1970s saw these concepts fall by the wayside, along with another plan to have theSpace Shuttledock with a Salyut space station. In the early 1980s,NASAplanned to launch a modular space station calledFreedomas a counterpart to the Salyut andMirspace stations. In 1984 the ESA was invited to participate in Space StationFreedom, and the ESA approved the Columbus laboratory by 1987.TheJapanese Experiment Module(JEM), orKibō, was announced in 1985, as part of theFreedomspace station in response to a NASA request in 1982. In early 1985, science ministers from theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) countries approved theColumbusprogramme, the most ambitious effort in space undertaken by that organization at the time. The plan spearheaded by Germany and Italy included a module which would be attached toFreedom, and with the capability to evolve into a full-fledged European orbital outpost before the end of the century. Increasing costs threw these plans into doubt in the early 1990s. Congress was unwilling to provide enough money to build and operateFreedom, and demanded NASA increase international participation to defray the rising costs or they would cancel the entire project outright. Simultaneously, the USSR was conducting planning for theMir-2space station, and had begun constructing modules for the new station by the mid-1980s. However thecollapse of the Soviet Unionrequired these plans to be greatly downscaled, and soon Mir-2 was in danger of never being launched at all.With both space station projects in jeopardy, American and Russian officials met and proposed they be combined. The ISS was originally intended to be a laboratory, observatory, and factory while providing transportation, maintenance, and alow Earth orbitstaging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. However, not all of the uses envisioned in the initialmemorandum of understandingbetweenNASAandRoscosmoshave been realised.In the2010 United States National Space Policy, the ISS was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic,and educational purposes. The ISS provides a platform to conduct scientific research, with power, data, cooling, and crew available to support experiments. Small uncrewed spacecraft can also provide platforms for experiments, especially those involving zero gravity and exposure to space, but space stations offer a long-term environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades, combined with ready access by human researchers. The ISS simplifies individual experiments by allowing groups of experiments to share the same launches and crew time. Research is conducted in a wide variety of fields, includingastrobiology,astronomy,physical sciences,materials science,space weather,meteorology, andhuman researchincludingspace medicineand thelife sciences.Scientists on Earth have timely access to the data and can suggest experimental modifications to the crew. If follow-on experiments are necessary, the routinely scheduled launches of resupply craft allows new hardware to be launched with relative ease.Crews flyexpeditionsof several months' duration, providing approximately 160 man-hours per week of labour with a crew of six. However, a considerable amount of crew time is taken up by station maintenance. Perhaps the most notable ISS experiment is theAlpha Magnetic Spectrometer(AMS), which is intended to detect dark matter and answer other fundamental questions about our universe. According to NASA, the AMS is as important as theHubble Space Telescope. Currently docked on station, it could not have been easily accommodated on a free flying satellite platform because of its power and bandwidth needs.On 3 April 2013, scientists reported that hints ofdark mattermay have been detected by the AMS.According to the scientists, "The first results from the space-borne Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer confirm an unexplained excess of high-energy positrons in Earth-bound cosmic rays". The space environment is hostile to life. Unprotected presence in space is characterised by an intense radiation field (consisting primarily of protons and other subatomic charged particles from thesolar wind, in addition tocosmic rays), high vacuum, extreme temperatures, and microgravity.Some simple forms of life calledextremophiles,as well as small invertebrates calledtardigradescan survive in this environment in an extremely dry state throughdesiccation. Medical research improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body, includingmuscle atrophy,bone loss, and fluid shift. These data will be used to determine whether high durationhuman spaceflightandspace colonisationare feasible. In 2006, data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggested that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise, such as the six-month interval required totravel to Mars. Medical studies are conducted aboard the ISS on behalf of theNational Space Biomedical Research Institute(NSBRI). Prominent among these is theAdvanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravitystudy in which astronauts perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts. The study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space. Usually, there is no physician on board the ISS and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge. It is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult. In August 2020, scientists reported thatbacteriafrom Earth, particularlyDeinococcus radioduransbacteria, which is highly resistant toenvironmental hazards, were found to survive for three years inouter space, based on studies conducted on the International Space Station. These findings supported the notion ofpanspermia, the hypothesis thatlifeexists throughout theUniverse, distributed in various ways, includingspace dust,meteoroids,asteroids,comets,planetoidsorcontaminatedspacecraft. Remote sensingof the Earth, astronomy, and deep space research on the ISS have significantly increased during the 2010s after the completion of theUS Orbital Segmentin 2011. Throughout the more than 20 years of the ISS program, researchers aboard the ISS and on the ground have examinedaerosols,ozone,lightning, andoxidesin Earth's atmosphere, as well as theSun, cosmic rays,cosmic dust,antimatter, and dark matter in the universe. Examples of Earth-viewing remote sensing experiments that have flown on the ISS are theOrbiting Carbon Observatory 3,ISS-RapidScat,ECOSTRESS, theGlobal Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation, and theCloud Aerosol Transport System. ISS-based astronomy telescopes and experiments includeSOLAR, theNeutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, theCalorimetric Electron Telescope, theMonitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI), and theAlpha Magnetic Spectrometer. Researchers are investigating the effect of the station's near-weightless environment on the evolution, development, growth and internal processes of plants and animals. In response to some of the data, NASA wants to investigatemicrogravity's effects on the growth of three-dimensional, human-like tissues and the unusualprotein crystalsthat can be formed in space. Investigating the physics of fluids in microgravity will provide better models of the behaviour of fluids. Because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity, physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on Earth. Examining reactions that are slowed by low gravity and low temperatures will improve our understanding ofsuperconductivity. The study ofmaterials scienceis an important ISS research activity, with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on Earth.Other areas of interest include the effect of low gravity on combustion, through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants. These findings may improve knowledge about energy production and lead to economic and environmental benefits. The ISS provides a location in the relative safety of low Earth orbit to test spacecraft systems that will be required for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. This provides experience in operations, maintenance, and repair and replacement activities on-orbit. This will help develop essential skills in operating spacecraft farther from Earth, reduce mission risks, and advance the capabilities of interplanetary spacecraft.Referring to theMARS-500experiment, a crew isolation experiment conducted on Earth, ESA states, "Whereas the ISS is essential for answering questions concerning the possible impact of weightlessness, radiation and other space-specific factors, aspects such as the effect of long-term isolation and confinement can be more appropriately addressed via ground-based simulations".Sergey Krasnov, the head of human space flight programmes for Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, in 2011 suggested a "shorter version" of MARS-500 may be carried out on the ISS. In 2009, noting the value of the partnership framework itself, Sergey Krasnov wrote, "When compared with partners acting separately, partners developing complementary abilities and resources could give us much more assurance of the success and safety of space exploration. The ISS is helping further advance near-Earth space exploration and realisation of prospective programmes of research and exploration of the Solar system, including the Moon and Mars."A crewed mission to Marsmay be a multinational effort involving space agencies and countries outside the current ISS partnership. In 2010, ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain stated his agency was ready to propose to the other four partners that China, India, and South Korea be invited to join the ISS partnership.NASA chiefCharles Boldenstated in February 2011, "Any mission to Mars is likely to be a global effort."Currently,US federal legislationprevents NASA co-operation with China on space projects without approval by theFBIand Congress. The ISS crew provides opportunities for students on Earth by running student-developed experiments, making educational demonstrations, allowing for student participation in classroom versions of ISS experiments, and directly engaging students using radio, and email.ESA offers a wide range of free teaching materials that can be downloaded for use in classrooms.In one lesson, students can navigate a3D modelof the interior and exterior of the ISS, and face spontaneous challenges to solve in real time. TheJapanese Aerospace Exploration Agency(JAXA) aims to inspire children to "pursue craftsmanship" and to heighten their "awareness of the importance of life and their responsibilities in society".Through a series of education guides, students develop a deeper understanding of the past and near-term future of crewed space flight, as well as that of Earth and life.In the JAXA "Seeds in Space" experiments, the mutation effects of spaceflight on plant seeds aboard the ISS are explored by growing sunflower seeds that have flown on the ISS for about nine months. In the first phase ofKibōutilisation from 2008 to mid-2010, researchers from more than a dozen Japanese universities conducted experiments in diverse fields. Cultural activities are another major objective of the ISS programme. Tetsuo Tanaka, the director of JAXA's Space Environment and Utilization Center, has said: "There is something about space that touches even people who are not interested in science." Amateur Radio on the ISS(ARISS) is a volunteer programme that encourages students worldwide to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, throughamateur radiocommunications opportunities with the ISS crew. ARISS is an international working group, consisting of delegations from nine countries including several in Europe, as well as Japan, Russia, Canada, and the United States. In areas where radio equipment cannot be used,speakerphonesconnect students to ground stations which then connect the calls to the space station. First Orbitis a 2011 feature-length documentary film aboutVostok 1, the first crewed space flight around the Earth. By matching the orbit of the ISS to that of Vostok 1 as closely as possible, in terms of ground path and time of day, documentary filmmakerChristopher Rileyand ESA astronautPaolo Nespoliwere able to film the view thatYuri Gagarinsaw on his pioneering orbital space flight. This new footage was cut together with the original Vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the Russian State Archive. Nespoli is credited as thedirector of photographyfor this documentary film, as he recorded the majority of the footage himself duringExpedition 26/27.The film was streamed in a global YouTube premiere in 2011 under a free licence through the websitefirstorbit.org. In May 2013, commanderChris Hadfieldshot a music video ofDavid Bowie's "Space Oddity" on board the station, which was released on YouTube.It was the first music video filmed in space. In November 2017, while participating inExpedition 52/53on the ISS,Paolo Nespolimade two recordings of his spoken voice (one in English and the other in his native Italian), for use onWikipediaarticles. These were the first content made in space specifically for Wikipedia. In November 2021, avirtual realityexhibit called The Infinite featuring life aboard the ISS was announced. Involving five space programs and fifteen countries,the International Space Station is the most politically and legally complex space exploration programme in history.The 1998 Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement sets forth the primary framework for international cooperation among the parties. A series of subsequent agreements govern other aspects of the station, ranging from jurisdictional issues to a code of conduct among visiting astronauts. Brazil was also invited to participate in the programme, the only developing country to receive such an invitation. Under the agreement framework, Brazil was to provide six pieces of hardware, and in exchange, would receive ISS utilization rights. However, Brazil was unable to deliver any of the elements due to a lack of funding and political priority within the country. Brazil officially dropped out of the ISS programme in 2007. Following the2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, continued cooperation between Russia and other countries on the International Space Station has been put into question. Roscosmos Director GeneralDmitry Rogozininsinuated that Russian withdrawal could cause the International Space Station to de-orbit due to lack of reboost capabilities, writing in a series of tweets, "If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an unguided de-orbit to impact on the territory of the US or Europe? There's also the chance of impact of the 500-ton construction in India or China. Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect? The ISS doesn't fly over Russia, so all the risk is yours. Are you ready for it?"(This latter claim is untrue: the ISS flies over all parts of the Earth between 51.6 degrees latitude north and south, approximately the latitude ofSaratov.) Rogozin later tweeted that normal relations between ISS partners could only be restored once sanctions have been lifted, and indicated that Roscosmos would submit proposals to the Russian government on ending cooperation.NASA stated that, if necessary, US corporationNorthrop Grummanhas offered a reboost capability that would keep the ISS in orbit. On 26 July 2022,Yury Borisov, Rogozin's successor as head of Roscosmos, submitted to Russian President Putin plans for withdrawal from the programme after 2024.However, Robyn Gatens, the NASA official in charge of the space station, responded that NASA had not received any formal notices from Roscosmos concerning withdrawal plans. The International Space Station is a product of global collaboration, with its components manufactured across the world. The modules of theRussian Orbital Segment, includingZaryaandZvezda, were produced at theKhrunichev State Research and Production Space Centerin Moscow.Zvezdawas initially manufactured in 1985 as a component for theMir-2space station, which was never launched. Much of theUS Orbital Segment, including theDestinyandUnitymodules, theIntegrated Truss Structure, andsolar arrays, were built at NASA'sMarshall Space Flight CenterinHuntsville, AlabamaandMichoud Assembly FacilityinNew Orleans.These components underwent final assembly and processing for launch at theOperations and Checkout Buildingand theSpace Station Processing Facility(SSPF) at theKennedy Space Centerin Florida. The US Orbital Segment also hosts theColumbusmodule contributed by theEuropean Space Agencyand built in Germany, theKibōmodule contributed byJapanand built at theTsukuba Space Centerand theInstitute of Space and Astronautical Science, along with theCanadarm2andDextre, a joint Canadian-U.S. endeavor. All of these components were shipped to the SSPF for launch processing. The assembly of the International Space Station, a major endeavour inspace architecture, began in November 1998. Modules in the Russian segment launched and docked autonomously, with the exception ofRassvet. Other modules and components were delivered by theSpace Shuttle, which then had to be installed by astronauts either remotely using robotic arms or during spacewalks, more formally known asextra-vehicular activities(EVAs). By 5 June 2011 astronauts had made over 159 EVAs to add components to the station, totaling more than 1,000 hours in space. The beginning of the core of the ISS's tenure in orbit was the launch of the Russian-builtZaryamodule atop aProton rocketon 20 November 1998.Zaryaprovided propulsion,attitude control, communications, and electrical power. Two weeks later on 4 December 1998, the American-madeUnitywas ferried aboardSpace ShuttleEndeavouronSTS-88and joined withZarya.Unityprovided the connection between the Russian and US segments of the station and would provide ports to connect future modules and visiting spacecraft. While the connection of two modules built on different continents, by nations that were once bitter rivals was a significant milestone, these two initial modules lacked life-support systems and the ISS remained unmanned for the next two years. At the time, the Russian stationMirwas still inhabited. The turning point arrived in July 2000 with the launch of theZvezdamodule. Equipped with living quarters and life-support systems,Zvezdaenabled continuous human presence aboard the station. The first crew,Expedition 1, arrived that November aboardSoyuz TM-31. The ISS grew steadily over the following years, with modules delivered by both Russian rockets and the Space Shuttle. Expedition 1 arrived midway between the Space Shuttle flights of missionsSTS-92andSTS-97. These two flights each added segments of the station'sIntegrated Truss Structure, which provided the station withKu bandcommunications, additional attitude control needed for the additional mass of the USOS, and additional solar arrays.Over the next two years, the station continued to expand. ASoyuz-Urocket delivered thePirsdocking compartment. The Space ShuttlesDiscovery,Atlantis, andEndeavourdelivered the AmericanDestinylaboratory andQuestairlock, in addition to the station's main robot arm, theCanadarm2, and several more segments of the Integrated Truss Structure. Tragedy struck in 2003 with theloss of the Space ShuttleColumbia, which grounded the rest of the Shuttle fleet, halting construction of the ISS. Assembly resumed in 2006 with the arrival ofSTS-115withAtlantis, which delivered the station's second set of solar arrays. Several more truss segments and a third set of arrays were delivered onSTS-116,STS-117, andSTS-118. As a result of the major expansion of the station's power-generating capabilities, more modules could be accommodated, and the USHarmonymodule andColumbusEuropean laboratory were added. These were soon followed by the first two components of the JapaneseKibōlaboratory. In March 2009,STS-119completed the Integrated Truss Structure with the installation of the fourth and final set of solar arrays. The final section ofKibōwas delivered in July 2009 onSTS-127, followed by the RussianPoiskmodule. The USTranquilitymodule was delivered in February 2010 duringSTS-130, alongside theCupola, followed by the penultimate Russian module,Rassvet, in May 2010.Rassvetwas delivered by Space ShuttleAtlantisonSTS-132in exchange for the Russian Proton delivery of the US-fundedZaryamodule in 1998.The last pressurised module of the USOS,Leonardo, was brought to the station in February 2011 on the final flight ofDiscovery,STS-133. Russia's new primary research moduleNaukadocked in July 2021,along with the European Robotic Arm which can relocate itself to different parts of the Russian modules of the station.Russia's latest addition, thePrichalmodule, docked in November 2021. As of June 2025, nasa.gov states that there are 43 different modules and elements installed on the ISS. The ISS functions as a modular space station, enabling the addition or removal of modules from its structure for increased adaptability. Below is a diagram of major station components. TheUnitynode joins directly to theDestinylaboratory; for clarity, they are shown apart. Similar cases are also seen in other parts of the structure. Key to box background colors: Zarya(Russian:Заря,lit.'Sunrise'[e]), also known as theFunctional Cargo Block(Russian:Функционально-грузовой блок), was the inaugural component of the ISS. Launched in 1998, it initially served as the ISS's power source, storage, propulsion, and guidance system. As the station has grown,Zarya's role has transitioned primarily to storage, both internally and in its external fuel tanks. A descendant of theTKS spacecraftused in theSalyutprogramme,Zaryawas built in Russia but is owned by the United States. Its name symbolizes the beginning of a new era of international space cooperation. Unity, also known asNode 1, is the inaugural U.S.-built component of the ISS.Serving as the connection between the Russian and U.S. segments, this cylindrical module features sixCommon Berthing Mechanismlocations (forward,aft,port,starboard,zenith, andnadir) for attaching additional modules. Measuring 4.57 metres (15.0 ft) in diameter and 5.47 metres (17.9 ft) in length,Unitywas constructed of steel byBoeingfor NASA at theMarshall Space Flight CenterinHuntsville, Alabama. It was the first of three connecting nodes –Unity,Harmony, andTranquility– that forms the structural backbone of the U.S. segment of the ISS. Zvezda(Russian:Звезда,lit.'star') launched in July 2000, is the core of theRussian Orbital Segmentof the ISS. Initially providing essential living quarters andlife-support systems, it enabled the first continuous human presence aboard the station. While additional modules have expanded the ISS's capabilities, Zvezda remains the command and control center for the Russian segment and it is where crews gather during emergencies. A descendant of the Salyut programme's DOS spacecraft, Zvezda was built byRKK Energiaand launched atop aProton rocket. TheDestinylaboratory is the primary research facility for U.S. experiments on the ISS. NASA's first permanent orbital research station since Skylab, the module was built by Boeing and launched aboardSpace ShuttleAtlantisduringSTS-98. Attached toUnityover a period of five days in February 2001,Destinyhas been a hub for scientific research ever since. WithinDestiny, astronauts conduct experiments in fields such as medicine, engineering, biotechnology, physics, materials science, and Earth science. Researchers worldwide benefit from these studies. The module also houses life-support systems, including theOxygen Generating System. TheQuest Joint Airlockenablesextravehicular activities(EVAs) using either the U.S.Extravehicular Mobility Unit(EMU) or the RussianOrlan space suit. Before its installation, conducting EVAs from the ISS was challenging due to a variety of system and design differences. Only the Orlan suit could be used from the Transfer Chamber on theZvezdamodule (which was not a purpose-built airlock) and the EMU could only be used from the airlock on a visiting Space Shuttle, which could not accommodate the Orlan. Launched aboardSpace ShuttleAtlantisduringSTS-104in July 2001 and attached to the Unity module, Quest is a 6.1-metre-long (20 ft), 4.0-metre-wide (13 ft) structure built by Boeing.It houses the crew airlock for astronaut egress, an equipment airlock for suit storage, and has facilities to accommodate astronauts during their overnight pre-breathe procedures to prevent decompression sickness. The crew airlock, derived from the Space Shuttle, features essential equipment like lighting, handrails, and an Umbilical Interface Assembly (UIA) that provides life-support and communication systems for up to two spacesuits simultaneously. These can be either two EMUs, two Orlan suits, or one of each design. Poisk(Russian:По́иск,lit.'Search'), also known as theMini-Research Module 2(Russian:Малый исследовательский модуль 2), serves as both a secondary airlock on the Russian segment of the ISS and supports docking for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, facilitates propellant transfers from the latter.Launched on 10 November 2009 attached to a modifiedProgress spacecraft, calledProgress M-MIM2. Poiskprovides facilities to maintain Orlan spacesuits and is equipped with two inward-opening hatches, a design change fromMir, which encountered a dangerous situation caused by an outward-opening hatch that opened too quickly because of a small amount of air pressure remaining in the airlock.Since the departure ofPirsin 2021, it's become the sole airlock on the Russian segment. Harmony, orNode 2, is the central connecting hub of the US segment of the ISS, linking the U.S., European, and Japanese laboratory modules. It's also been called the "utility hub" of the ISS as it provides essential power, data, and life-support systems. The module also houses sleeping quarters for four crew members. Launched on 23 October 2007 aboardSpace ShuttleDiscoveryonSTS-120,Harmony was initially attached to the Unitybefore being relocated to its permanent position at the front of the Destiny laboratory on 14 November 2007.This expansion added significant living space to the ISS, marking a key milestone in the construction of the U.S. segment. Tranquility, also known asNode 3, is a module of the ISS. It contains environmental control systems,life-support systems, a toilet, exercise equipment, and an observationcupola. The European Space Agency and theItalian Space AgencyhadTranquilitymanufactured byThales Alenia Space. A ceremony on 20 November 2009 transferred ownership of the module to NASA.On 8 February 2010, NASA launched the module on the Space Shuttle'sSTS-130mission. Columbusis a science laboratory that is part of the ISS and is the largest single contribution to the station made by the European Space Agency. Like theHarmonyandTranquilitymodules, theColumbuslaboratory was constructed inTurin, Italy byThales Alenia Space. The functional equipment and software of the lab was designed byEADSinBremen, Germany. It was also integrated in Bremen before being flown to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in anAirbus Belugajet. It was launched aboard Space ShuttleAtlantison 7 February 2008, on flightSTS-122. It is designed for ten years of operation. The module is controlled by theColumbus Control Centre, located at theGerman Space Operations Center, part of theGerman Aerospace CenterinOberpfaffenhofennearMunich, Germany. The European Space Agency has spent€1.4 billion (aboutUS$1.6 billion) on buildingColumbus, including the experiments it carries and the ground control infrastructure necessary to operate them. Kibō(Japanese:きぼう;lit.'hope'), also known as theJapanese Experiment Module, is Japan's research facility on the ISS. It is the largest single module on the ISS, consisting of a pressurized lab, an exposed facility for conducting experiments in the space environment, two storage compartments, and a robotic arm. Attached to theHarmonymodule,Kibōwas assembled in space over three Space Shuttle missions:STS-123,STS-124andSTS-127. TheCupolais anESA-built observatory module of the ISS. Its name derives from the Italian wordcupola, which means "dome". Its seven windows are used to conduct experiments, dockings and observations of Earth. It was launched aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-130 on 8 February 2010 and attached to theTranquility(Node 3) module. With theCupolaattached, ISS assembly reached 85 per cent completion. TheCupola'scentral window has a diameter of 80 cm (31 in). Rassvet(Russian:Рассвет,lit.'first light'), also known as theMini-Research Module 1(Russian:Малый исследовательский модуль 1) and formerly known as theDocking Cargo Moduleis primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft on the Russian segment of the ISS.Rassvetreplaced the cancelled Docking and Storage Module and used a design largely based on theMir Docking Modulebuilt in 1995. Rassvet was delivered in on 14 May 2010Space ShuttleAtlantisonSTS-132in exchange for the Russian Proton delivery of the US-fundedZaryamodule in 1998.Rassvetwas attached toZaryashortly thereafter. TheLeonardoPermanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) was flown into space aboard the Space ShuttleDiscoveryonSTS-133on 24 February 2011 and installed on 1 March.Leonardois primarily used for storage of spares, supplies and waste on the ISS, which was until then stored in many different places within the space station. It is also the personal hygiene area for the astronauts who live in theUS Orbital Segment. TheLeonardoPMM was aMulti-Purpose Logistics Module(MPLM) before 2011, but was modified into its current configuration. It was formerly one of two MPLM used for bringing cargo to and from the ISS with the Space Shuttle. The module was named for Italian polymathLeonardo da Vinci. TheBigelow Expandable Activity Module(BEAM) is an experimentalexpandablespace station moduledeveloped byBigelow Aerospace, under contract to NASA, for testing as a temporary module on the International Space Station (ISS) from 2016 to at least 2020. It arrived at the ISS on 10 April 2016,was berthed to the station on 16 April at Tranquility Node 3, and was expanded and pressurized on 28 May 2016. In December 2021, Bigelow Aerospace conveyed ownership of the module to NASA, as a result of Bigelow's cessation of activity. TheInternational Docking Adapter(IDA) is aspacecraft docking system adapterdeveloped to convertAPAS-95to theNASA Docking System(NDS). An IDA is placed on each of the ISS's two openPressurized Mating Adapters(PMAs), both of which are connected to theHarmonymodule. Two International Docking Adapters are currently installed aboard the Station. Originally,IDA-1was planned to be installed on PMA-2, located atHarmony's forward port, andIDA-2would be installed on PMA-3 atHarmony's zenith. After IDA 1 was destroyed ina launch incident,IDA-2was installed on PMA-2 on 19 August 2016,whileIDA-3was later installed on PMA-3 on 21 August 2019. The NanoRacks Bishop Airlock Module is acommerciallyfundedairlockmodule launched to the ISS onSpaceX CRS-21on 6 December 2020.The module was built byNanoRacks,Thales Alenia Space, and Boeing.It will be used to deployCubeSats,small satellites, and other external payloads for NASA,CASIS, and other commercial and governmental customers. Nauka(Russian:Наука,lit.'Science'), also known as theMultipurpose Laboratory Module, Upgrade(Russian:Многоцелевой лабораторный модуль, усоверше́нствованный), is a Roscosmos-funded component of the ISS that was launched on 21 July 2021, 14:58 UTC. In the original ISS plans,Naukawas to use the location of theDocking and Stowage Module(DSM), but the DSM was later replaced by theRassvetmodule and moved toZarya's nadir port.Naukawas successfully docked toZvezda's nadir port on 29 July 2021, 13:29 UTC, replacing thePirsmodule. It had a temporary docking adapter on its nadir port for crewed and uncrewed missions until Prichal arrival, where just before its arrival it was removed by a departing Progress spacecraft. Prichal(Russian:Причал,lit.'pier') is a 4-tonne (8,800 lb) spherical module that serves as a docking hub for the Russian segment of the ISS. Launched in November 2021, Prichal provides additional docking ports for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, as well as potential future modules.Prichalfeatures six docking ports: forward, aft, port, starboard, zenith, and nadir. One of these ports, equipped with an active hybrid docking system, enabled it to dock with the Nauka module. The remaining five ports are passive hybrids, allowing for docking of Soyuz, Progress, and heavier modules, as well as future spacecraft with modified docking systems. As of 2024, the forward, aft, port and starboard docking ports remain covered.Prichalwas initially intended to be an element of the now canceledOrbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex. The ISS has a large number of external components that do not require pressurisation. The largest of these is theIntegrated Truss Structure(ITS), to which the station's mainsolar arraysandthermal radiatorsare mounted.The ITS consists of ten separate segments forming a structure 108.5 metres (356 ft) long. The station was intended to have several smaller external components, such as six robotic arms, threeExternal Stowage Platforms(ESPs) and fourExPRESS Logistics Carriers(ELCs).While these platforms allow experiments (includingMISSE, the STP-H3 and theRobotic Refueling Mission) to be deployed and conducted in the vacuum of space by providing electricity and processing experimental data locally, their primary function is to store spareOrbital Replacement Units(ORUs). ORUs are parts that can be replaced when they fail or pass their design life, including pumps, storage tanks, antennas, and battery units. Such units are replaced either by astronauts during EVA or by robotic arms.Several shuttle missions were dedicated to the delivery of ORUs, includingSTS-129,STS-133and STS-134.As of January 2011[update], only one other mode of transportation of ORUs had been used – the Japanese cargo vesselHTV-2– which delivered an FHRC and CTC-2 via its Exposed Pallet (EP).[needs update] There are also smaller exposure facilities mounted directly to laboratory modules; theKibōExposed Facilityserves as an external "porch" for theKibōcomplex,and a facility on the EuropeanColumbuslaboratory provides power and data connections for experiments such as theEuropean Technology Exposure Facilityand theAtomic Clock Ensemble in Space.Aremote sensinginstrument,SAGE III-ISS, was delivered to the station in February 2017 aboardCRS-10,and theNICERexperiment was delivered aboardCRS-11in June 2017.The largest scientific payload externally mounted to the ISS is theAlpha Magnetic Spectrometer(AMS), a particle physics experiment launched on STS-134 in May 2011, and mounted externally on the ITS. The AMS measures cosmic rays to look for evidence of dark matter and antimatter. The commercialBartolomeoExternal Payload Hosting Platform, manufactured by Airbus, was launched on 6 March 2020 aboardCRS-20and attached to the EuropeanColumbusmodule. It will provide an additional 12 external payload slots, supplementing the eight on theExPRESS Logistics Carriers, ten onKibō, and four onColumbus. The system is designed to be robotically serviced and will require no astronaut intervention. It is named after Christopher Columbus's younger brother. In May 2010, equipment forNaukawas launched on STS-132 (as part of an agreement with NASA) and delivered by Space ShuttleAtlantis. Weighing 1.4 metric tons, the equipment was attached to the outside ofRassvet(MRM-1). It included a spare elbow joint for theEuropean Robotic Arm(ERA) (which was launched withNauka) and an ERA-portable workpost used during EVAs, as well as RTOd add-on heat radiator and internal hardware alongside the pressurized experiment airlock. The RTOd radiator adds additional cooling capability toNauka, which enables the module to host more scientific experiments. The ERA was used to remove the RTOd radiator fromRassvetand transferred over toNaukaduring VKD-56 spacewalk. Later it was activated and fully deployed on VKD-58 spacewalk.This process took several months. A portable work platform was also transferred over in August 2023 during VKD-60 spacewalk, which can attach to the end of the ERA to allow cosmonauts to "ride" on the end of the arm during spacewalks.However, even after several months of outfitting EVAs and RTOd heat radiator installation, six months later, the RTOd radiator malfunctioned before active use of Nauka (the purpose of RTOd installation is to radiate heat from Nauka experiments). The malfunction, a leak, rendered the RTOd radiator unusable for Nauka. This is the third ISS radiator leak afterSoyuz MS-22andProgress MS-21radiator leaks. If a spare RTOd is not available, Nauka experiments will have to rely on Nauka's main launch radiator and the module could never be used to its full capacity. Another MLM outfitting is a 4 segment external payload interface called means of attachment of large payloads (Sredstva Krepleniya Krupnogabaritnykh Obyektov, SKKO).Delivered in two parts to Nauka byProgress MS-18(LCCS part) andProgress MS-21(SCCCS part) as part of the module activation outfitting process.It was taken outside and installed on the ERA aft facing base point on Nauka during the VKD-55 spacewalk. The Integrated Truss Structure (ITS) serves as a base for the station's primary remote manipulator system, theMobile Servicing System(MSS), which is composed of three main components: Agrapple fixturewas added toZaryaon STS-134 to enable Canadarm2 to inchworm itself onto the ROS.Also installed during STS-134 was the 15 m (50 ft)Orbiter Boom Sensor System(OBSS), which had been used to inspect heat shield tiles on Space Shuttle missions and which can be used on the station to increase the reach of the MSS.Staff on Earth or the ISS can operate the MSS components using remote control, performing work outside the station without the need for space walks. Japan'sRemote Manipulator System, which services theKibōExposed Facility,was launched onSTS-124and is attached to theKibōPressurised Module.The arm is similar to the Space Shuttle arm as it is permanently attached at one end and has a latching end effector for standard grapple fixtures at the other. TheEuropean Robotic Arm, which will service the ROS, was launched alongside theNaukamodule.The ROS does not require spacecraft or modules to be manipulated, as all spacecraft and modules dock automatically and may be discarded the same way. Crew use the twoStrela(Russian:Стрела́,lit.'Arrow') cargo cranes during EVAs for moving crew and equipment around the ROS. Each Strela crane has a mass of 45 kg (99 lb). Pirs (Russian: Пирс, lit. 'Pier') was launched on 14 September 2001, as ISS Assembly Mission 4R, on a Russian Soyuz-U rocket, using a modifiedProgress spacecraft,Progress M-SO1, as an upper stage. Pirs was undocked byProgress MS-16on 26 July 2021, 10:56 UTC, and deorbited on the same day at 14:51 UTC to make room for theNaukamodule to be attached to the space station. Prior to its departure, Pirs served as the primary Russian airlock on the station, being used to store and refurbish the Russian Orlan spacesuits. In January 2020, NASA awardedAxiom Spacea contract to build a commercial module for the ISS. The contract is under theNextSTEP2program. NASA negotiated with Axiom on a firmfixed-price contractbasis to build and deliver the module, which will attach to the forward port of the space station'sHarmony (Node 2)module. Although NASA only commissioned one module, Axiom planned to build an entire segment consisting of five modules, including a node module, an orbital research and manufacturing facility, a crew habitat, and a "large-windowed Earth observatory". The Axiom segment was expected to greatly increase the capabilities and value of the space station, allowing for larger crews and private spaceflight by other organisations. Axiom planned to convert the segment into a stand-alone space station once the ISS is decommissioned, with the intention that this would act as a successor to the ISS.Canadarm2is planned to continue its operations on Axiom Station after the retirement of ISS in 2030.In December 2024, Axiom Space revised their station assembly plans to require only one module to dock with the ISS before assembling Axiom Station in an independent orbit. As of December 2024[update], Axiom Space expects to launch one module, the Payload Power Thermal Module (PPTM), to the ISS no earlier than 2027.PPTM is expected to remain at the ISS until the launch of Axiom's Habitat One (Hab-1) module about one year later, after which it will detach from the ISS to join with Hab-1. TheUS Deorbit Vehicle(USDV) is a NASA-provided spacecraft intended to perform a controlled de-orbit and demise of the station after the end of its operational life in 2030. In June 2024, NASA awardedSpaceXa contract to build the Deorbit Vehicle.NASA plans to de-orbit ISS as soon as they have the "minimum capability" in orbit: "the USDV and at least one commercial station." Several modules developed or planned for the station were cancelled over the course of the ISS programme. Reasons include budgetary constraints, the modules becoming unnecessary, and station redesigns after the 2003Columbiadisaster. The USCentrifuge Accommodations Modulewould have hosted science experiments in varying levels ofartificial gravity.The USHabitation Modulewould have served as the station's living quarters. Instead, the living quarters are now spread throughout the station.The USInterim Control ModuleandISS Propulsion Modulewould have replaced the functions ofZvezdain case of a launch failure.TwoRussian Research Moduleswere planned for scientific research.They would have docked to a RussianUniversal Docking Module.The RussianScience Power Platformwould have supplied power to the Russian Orbital Segment independent of the ITS solar arrays. Science Power Module 1(SPM-1, also known asNEM-1) andScience Power Module 2(SPM-2, also known asNEM-2) are modules that were originally planned to arrive at the ISS no earlier than 2024, and dock to thePrichalmodule, which is docked to theNaukamodule.In April 2021, Roscosmos announced that NEM-1 would be repurposed to function as the core module of the proposedRussian Orbital Service Station(ROSS), launching no earlier than 2027and docking to the free-flyingNaukamodule.NEM-2 may be converted into another core "base" module, which would be launched in 2028. Designed byBigelow Aerospace. In August 2016, Bigelow negotiated an agreement with NASA to develop a full-size ground prototype Deep Space Habitation based on the B330 under the second phase of Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships. The module was called the Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE), as Bigelow hoped to test the module by attaching it to the International Space Station. However, in March 2020, Bigelow laid off all 88 of its employees, and as of February 2024[update]the company remains dormant and is considered defunct,making it appear unlikely that the XBASE module will ever be launched. A proposal was put forward in 2011 for a first in-space demonstration of a sufficiently scaled centrifuge for artificial partial-g gravity effects. It was designed to become a sleep module for the ISS crew. The project was cancelled in favour of other projects due to budget constraints. The critical systems are the atmosphere control system, the water supply system, the food supply facilities, the sanitation and hygiene equipment, and fire detection and suppression equipment. The Russian Orbital Segment's life-support systems are contained in theZvezdaservice module. Some of these systems are supplemented by equipment in the USOS. TheNaukalaboratory has a complete set of life-support systems. The atmosphere on board the ISS is similar tothat of Earth.Normal air pressure on the ISS is 101.3 kPa (14.69 psi);the same as at sea level on Earth. An Earth-like atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort, and is much safer than a pure oxygen atmosphere, because of the increased risk of a fire such as that responsible for the deaths of theApollo 1crew.[better source needed]Earth-like atmospheric conditions have been maintained on all Russian and Soviet spacecraft. TheElektronsystem aboardZvezdaand a similar system inDestinygenerate oxygen aboard the station.The crew has a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen andSolid Fuel Oxygen Generation(SFOG) canisters, achemical oxygen generatorsystem.Carbon dioxide is removed from the air by theVozdukhsystem inZvezda. Other by-products of human metabolism, such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat, are removed byactivated charcoalfilters. Part of the ROS atmosphere control system is the oxygen supply. Triple-redundancy is provided by the Elektron unit, solid fuel generators, and stored oxygen. The primary supply of oxygen is the Elektron unit which producesO2andH2byelectrolysisof water and ventsH2overboard. The 1 kW (1.3 hp) system uses approximately one litre of water per crew member per day. This water is either brought from Earth or recycled from other systems.Mirwas the first spacecraft to use recycled water for oxygen production. The secondary oxygen supply is provided by burning oxygen-producingVikacartridges (see alsoISS ECLSS). Each 'candle' takes 5–20 minutes to decompose at 450–500 °C (842–932 °F), producing 600 litres (130 imp gal; 160 US gal) ofO2. This unit is manually operated. The US Orbital Segment (USOS) has redundant supplies of oxygen, from a pressurised storage tank on theQuestairlock module delivered in 2001, supplemented ten years later by ESA-built Advanced Closed-Loop System (ACLS) in theTranquilitymodule (Node 3), which producesO2by electrolysis.Hydrogen produced is combined with carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere and converted to water and methane. Double-sidedsolar arraysprovideelectrical powerto the ISS. These bifacial cells collect direct sunlight on one side and lightreflected offfrom the Earth on the other, and are more efficient and operate at a lower temperature than single-sided cells commonly used on Earth. The Russian segment of the station, like most spacecraft, uses 28Vlow voltageDCfrom two rotating solar arrays mounted onZvezda. The USOS uses 130–180 V DC from the USOS PV array. Power is stabilised and distributed at 160 V DC and converted to the user-required 124 V DC. Thehigher distribution voltageallows smaller, lighter conductors, at the expense of crew safety. The two station segments share power with converters. The USOS solar arrays are arranged as four wing pairs, for a total production of 75 to 90 kilowatts.These arrays normally track the Sun to maximise power generation. Each array is about 375 m2(4,036 sq ft) in area and 58 m (190 ft) long. In the complete configuration, the solar arrays track the Sun by rotating thealphagimbalonce per orbit; thebeta gimbalfollows slower changes in the angle of the Sun to the orbital plane. TheNight Glider modealigns the solar arrays parallel to the ground at night to reduce the significant aerodynamic drag at the station's relatively low orbital altitude. The station originally used rechargeablenickel–hydrogen batteries(NiH2) for continuous power during the 45 minutes of every 90-minute orbit that it is eclipsed by the Earth. The batteries are recharged on the day side of the orbit. They had a 6.5-year lifetime (over 37,000 charge/discharge cycles) and were regularly replaced over the anticipated 20-year life of the station.Starting in 2016, the nickel–hydrogen batteries were replaced bylithium-ion batteries, which are expected to last until the end of the ISS program. The station's large solar panels generate a high potential voltage difference between the station and the ionosphere. This could cause arcing through insulating surfaces and sputtering of conductive surfaces as ions are accelerated by the spacecraft plasma sheath. To mitigate this,plasma contactorunits create current paths between the station and the ambient space plasma. The station's systems and experiments consume a large amount of electrical power, almost all of which is converted to heat. To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquidammonialoop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then the ammonia is cycled back to the station.The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, includingKibōandColumbus, as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70 kW. This is much more than the 14 kW of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched onSTS-105and installed onto the P6 Truss. The ISS relies on various radio communication systems to providetelemetryand scientific data links between the station andmission control centres. Radio links are also used duringrendezvous and docking proceduresand for audio and video communication between crew members, flight controllers and family members. As a result, the ISS is equipped with internal and external communication systems used for different purposes. The Russian Orbital Segment primarily uses theLiraantenna mounted onZvezdafor direct ground communication.It also had the capability to utilize theLuchdata relay satellite system,which was in a state of disrepair when the station was built,but was restored to operational status in 2011 and 2012 with the launch of Luch-5A and Luch-5B.Additionally, theVoskhod-Msystem provides internal telephone communications and VHF radio links to ground control. TheUS Orbital Segment(USOS) makes use of two separate radio links:S band(audio, telemetry, commanding – located on the P1/S1 truss) andKuband(audio, video and data – located on theZ1 truss) systems. These transmissions are routed via the United StatesTracking and Data Relay SatelliteSystem (TDRSS) ingeostationary orbit, allowing for almost continuous real-time communications withChristopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center(MCC-H) inHouston, Texas.Data channels for the Canadarm2, EuropeanColumbuslaboratory and JapaneseKibōmodules were originally also routed via the S band and Kuband systems, with theEuropean Data Relay Systemand a similar Japanese system intended to eventually complement the TDRSS in this role. UHF radiois used by astronauts and cosmonauts conducting EVAs and other spacecraft that dock to or undock from the station.Automated spacecraft are fitted with their own communications equipment; the ATV used alaserattached to the spacecraft and the Proximity Communications Equipment attached toZvezdato accurately dock with the station. The US Orbital Segment of the ISS is equipped with approximately 100commercial off-the-shelflaptops running Windows or Linux.These devices are modified to use the station's 28V DC power system and with additional ventilation since heat generated by the devices can stagnate in the weightless environment. NASA prefers to keep a high commonality between laptops and spare parts are kept on the station so astronauts can repair laptops when needed. The laptops are divided into two groups: the Portable Computer System (PCS) and Station Support Computers (SSC). PCS laptops run Linux and are used for connecting to the station's primary Command & Control computer (C&C MDM), which runs onDebianLinux,a switch made from Windows in 2013 for reliability and flexibility.The primary computer supervises the critical systems that keep the station in orbit and supporting life.Since the primary computer has no display or keyboards, astronauts use a PCS laptop to connect as remote terminals via a USB to1553adapter.The primary computer experienced failures in 2001,2007,and 2017. The 2017 failure required a spacewalk to replace external components. SSC laptops are used for everything else on the station, including reviewing procedures, managing scientific experiments, communicating over e-mail or video chat, and for entertainment during downtime.SSC laptops connect to the station'swireless LANviaWi-Fi, which connects to the ground via the Kuband. While originally this provided speeds of 10Mbit/sdownload and 3 Mbit/s upload from the station,NASA upgraded the system in 2019 and increased the speeds to 600 Mbit/s.ISS crew members have access to theinternet. Each permanent crew is given an expedition number. Expeditions run up to six months, from launch until undocking, an 'increment' covers the same time period, but includes cargo spacecraft and all activities. Expeditions 1 to 6 consisted of three-person crews. After the destruction of NASA's Space ShuttleColumbia, Expeditions 7 to 12 were reduced to two-person "caretaker" crews who could maintain the station, because a larger crew could not be fully resupplied by the small Russian Progress cargo spacecraft.After the Shuttle fleet returned to flight, three person crews also returned to the ISS beginning with Expedition 13. As the Shuttle flights expanded the station, crew sizes also expanded, eventually reaching six around 2010.With the arrival of crew on larger UScommercial spacecraftbeginning in 2020,crew size has been increased to seven, the number for which ISS was originally designed. Oleg Kononenkoof Roscosmos holds the record for the longest time spent in space and at the ISS, accumulating nearly 1,111 days in space over the course of five long-duration missions on the ISS (Expedition 17,30/31,44/45,57/58/59and69/70/71). He also served as commander three times (Expedition 31, 58/59 and 70/71). Peggy Whitsonof NASA andAxiom Spacehas spent the most time in space of any American, accumulating over 675 days in space during her time on Expeditions5,16, and50/51/52and Axiom Missions2and4. Travellers who pay for their own passage into space are termedspaceflight participantsby Roscosmos and NASA, and are sometimes referred to as "space tourists", a term they generally dislike.[f]As of June 2023[update], thirteen space tourists have visited the ISS; nine were transported to the ISS on Russian Soyuz spacecraft, and four were transported on AmericanSpaceX Dragon 2spacecraft. For one-tourist missions, when professional crews change over in numbers not divisible by the three seats in a Soyuz, and a short-stay crewmember is not sent, the spare seat is sold by MirCorp through Space Adventures. Space tourism was halted in 2011 when the Space Shuttle was retired and the station's crew size was reduced to six, as the partners relied on Russian transport seats for access to the station. Soyuz flight schedules increased after 2013, allowing five Soyuz flights (15 seats) with only two expeditions (12 seats) required.The remaining seats were to be sold for around US$40 million each to members of the public who could pass a medical exam. ESA and NASA criticised private spaceflight at the beginning of the ISS, and NASA initially resisted trainingDennis Tito, the first person to pay for his own passage to the ISS.[g] Anousheh Ansaribecame the first self-funded woman to fly to the ISS as well as the first Iranian in space. Officials reported that her education and experience made her much more than a tourist, and her performance in training had been "excellent."She did Russian and European studies involving medicine and microbiology during her 10-day stay. The 2009 documentarySpace Touristsfollows her journey to the station, where she fulfilled "an age-old dream of man: to leave our planet as a 'normal person' and travel into outer space." In 2008, spaceflight participantRichard Garriottplaced ageocacheaboard the ISS during his flight.This is the first non-terrestrial geocache in history.At the same time, theImmortality Drive, an electronic record of eight digitised humanDNA sequences, was placed aboard the ISS. After a 12-year hiatus, the first two wholly space tourism-dedicated private spaceflights to the ISS were undertaken.Soyuz MS-20launched in December 2021, carrying visiting Roscosmos cosmonautAlexander Misurkinand two Japanese space tourists under the aegis of the private companySpace Adventures;in April 2022, the companyAxiom Spacechartered aSpaceX Dragon 2spacecraft and sent its own employee astronautMichael Lopez-Alegriaand three space tourists to the ISS forAxiom Mission 1,followed in May 2023 by one more tourist,John Shoffner, alongside employee astronautPeggy Whitsonand two Saudi astronauts for theAxiom Mission 2. The first all private astronaut mission (PAM) to the ISS wasAxiom Mission 1, which launched in April, 2022.After evaluating previous flights to ISS which included private spaceflight participants, and the first three flights including only private astronauts, NASA updated requirements for entities providing PAMs.As of August 2025[update]the most recent mission wasAxiom Mission 4. NASA intends to offer up to two PAM opportunities per year. Various crewed and uncrewed spacecraft have supported the station's operations. Flights to the ISS have included 93 Progress,[h]72 Soyuz, 50SpaceX Dragon[i]37 Space Shuttle, 21Cygnus, 9HTV, 5ATV, and 2Boeing Starlinermissions. There are currently eight docking ports for visiting spacecraft, with four additional ports installed but not yet put into service: Forwardports are at the front of the station in its usual orientation and direction of travel.Aftis the opposite, at the rear.Nadirpoints toward Earth, whilezenithpoints away from it.Portis to the left andstarboardto the right when one's feet are toward Earth and one is facing forward, in the direction of travel. Cargo spacecraft that will perform an orbital re-boost of the station will typically dock at an aft, forward or nadir-facing port. As of 4 August 2025[ref], a total of 290 individuals from 26 countries had visited the International Space Station (ISS), including both government-sponsored astronauts and privately funded spaceflight participants. The United States accounted for 170 of these visitors, followed by Russia with 64, Japan with 11, andCanadawith 9.Italyhad 6 visitors, whileFranceandGermanyhad each sent 4.Saudi Arabia,Sweden, and theUnited Arab Emirateseach had 2 individuals visit the ISS. One person had traveled to the ISS from each of the following countries:Belarus,Belgium,Brazil,Denmark,Hungary,India,Israel,Kazakhstan,Malaysia, theNetherlands,Poland,South Africa,South Korea,Spain,Turkey, and theUnited Kingdom. Uncrewed spaceflights are primarily used to deliver cargo to the station including crew supplies, scientific investigations, spacewalk equipment, vehicle hardware, propellant, water, and gases. Cargo resupply missions have typically used Russian Progress spacecraft, the now-retired European ATV, the Japanese HTV, and American Dragon and Cygnus spacecraft. Additionally, several Russian modules have been launched on uncrewed rockets and autonomously docked with the station. All dates areUTC. Departure dates are the earliest possible (NET) and may change. All dates areUTC. Launch dates are the earliest possible (NET) and may change. Russian spacecraft can autonomously rendezvous and dock with the station without human intervention. Once within about 200 kilometres (120 mi) the spacecraft activates itsKurs docking navigation system, exchanging radio signals with the station's beacon to guide orbital manoeuvres. As it closes in, more accurate transceivers align the craft with the docking port and control the final approach. The crew supervises the procedure and can intervene using theTORU(Tele-robotically Operated Rendezvous Unit) system if required.Automated docking has been used by the Soviet programme since 1967, with Kurs introduced onMirin 1986 and refined since. Though costly to develop, its reliability and standardised components have delivered significant long-term savings. The AmericanSpaceX Dragon 2cargo and crewed spacecraft can autonomously rendezvous and dock with the station without human intervention. However, on crewed Dragon missions, the astronauts have the capability to intervene and fly the vehicle manually. Otherautomated cargo spacecrafttypically use a semi-automated process when arriving and departing from the station. These spacecraft are instructed to approach and park near the station. Once the crew on board the station is ready, the spacecraft is commanded to come close to the station, so that it can be grappled by an astronaut using theMobile Servicing Systemrobotic arm. The final mating of the spacecraft to the station is achieved using the robotic arm (a process known as berthing). Spacecraft using this semi-automated process include the AmericanCygnusand the JapaneseHTV-X. The now-retired AmericanSpaceX Dragon 1, EuropeanATVand JapaneseHTValso used this process. Prior to a spacecraft's docking to the ISS, navigation and attitude control (GNC) is handed over to the ground control of the spacecraft's country of origin. GNC is set to allow the station to drift in space, rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes. The solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming spacecraft, so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells. Before its retirement, Shuttle launches were often given priority over Soyuz, with occasional priority given to Soyuz arrivals carrying crew and time-critical cargoes, such as biological experiment materials. Orbital Replacement Units(ORUs) are spare parts that can be readily replaced when a unit either passes its design life or fails. Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets calledExPRESS Logistics Carriers(ELCs) or share larger platforms calledExternal Stowage Platforms(ESPs) which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, Cygnus and Dragon, carry one tenth to one quarter the payload. Unexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons. Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004,the venting of fumes from anElektronoxygen generator in 2006,and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 duringSTS-117that left the station without thruster,Elektron,Vozdukhand other environmental control system operations. In the latter case, the root cause was found to be condensation inside electrical connectors leading to a short circuit. During STS-120 in 2007 and following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays, it was noted during unfurling that the solar array had torn and was not deploying properly.An EVA was carried out byScott Parazynski, assisted byDouglas Wheelock. Extra precautions were taken to reduce the risk of electric shock, as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight.The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station. Excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 andSTS-123showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic bearing surfaces, so the joint was locked to prevent further damage.Repairs to the joints were carried out duringSTS-126with lubrication and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint. In September 2008, damage to the S1 radiator was first noticed in Soyuz imagery. The problem was initially not thought to be serious.The imagery showed that the surface of one sub-panel had peeled back from the underlying central structure, possibly because of micro-meteoroid or debris impact. On 15 May 2009, the damaged radiator panel's ammonia tubing was mechanically shut off from the rest of the cooling system by the computer-controlled closure of a valve. The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak.It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, but its effect, if any, has not been determined. In the early hours of 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid. Several subsystems, including two of the four CMGs, were shut down. Planned operations on the ISS were interrupted through a series of EVAs to address the cooling system issue. A first EVA on 7 August 2010, to replace the failed pump module, was not fully completed because of an ammonia leak in one of four quick-disconnects. A second EVA on 11 August removed the failed pump module.A third EVA was required to restore Loop A to normal functionality. The USOS's cooling system is largely built by the US company Boeing,which is also the manufacturer of the failed pump. The four Main Bus Switching Units (MBSUs, located in the S0 truss), control the routing of power from the four solar array wings to the rest of the ISS. Each MBSU has two power channels that feed 160V DC from the arrays to two DC-to-DC power converters (DDCUs) that supply the 124V power used in the station. In late 2011, MBSU-1 ceased responding to commands or sending data confirming its health. While still routing power correctly, it was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available EVA. A spare MBSU was already on board, but a 30 August 2012 EVA failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before the electrical connection was secured.The loss of MBSU-1 limited the station to 75% of its normal power capacity, requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem could be addressed. On 5 September 2012, in a second six-hour EVA, astronauts Sunita Williams and Akihiko Hoshide successfully replaced MBSU-1 and restored the ISS to 100% power. On 24 December 2013, astronauts installed a new ammonia pump for the station's cooling system. The faulty cooling system had failed earlier in the month, halting many of the station's science experiments. Astronauts had to brave a "mini blizzard" of ammonia while installing the new pump. It was only the second Christmas Eve spacewalk in NASA history. The components of the ISS are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies atmission control centresacross the globe, primarily theChristopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Centerin Houston and theRKA Mission Control Center(TsUP) in Moscow, with support fromTsukuba Space Centerin Japan,Payload Operations and Integration Centerin Huntsville, Alabama, U.S.,Columbus Control Centerin Munich, Germany andMobile Servicing SystemControl at theCanadian Space Agency's headquarters inSaint-Hubert, Quebec. The ISS is currently maintained in a nearly circular orbit with a minimum mean altitude of 370 km (230 mi) and a maximum of 460 km (290 mi),in the centre of thethermosphere, at aninclinationof 51.6 degrees to Earth's equatorwith an eccentricity of 0.0002267.[needs update]This orbit was selected because it is the lowest inclination that can be directly reached by Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft launched fromBaikonur Cosmodromeat 46° N latitude without overflying China or dropping spent rocket stages in inhabited areas.It travels at an average speed of 28,000 kilometres per hour (17,000 mph), and completes 15.5 orbits per day (93 minutes per orbit).The station's altitude was allowed to fall around the time of each NASA shuttle flight to permit heavier loads to be transferred to the station. After the retirement of the shuttle, the nominal orbit of the space station was raised in altitude (from about 350 km to about 400 km).Other, more frequent supply spacecraft do not require this adjustment as they are substantially higher performance vehicles. Atmospheric drag reduces the altitude by about 2 km a month on average. Orbital boosting can be performed by the station's two main engines on theZvezdaservice module, or Russian or European spacecraft docked toZvezda'saft port. The Automated Transfer Vehicle is constructed with the possibility of adding asecond docking portto its aft end, allowing other craft to dock and boost the station. It takes approximately two orbits (three hours) for the boost to a higher altitude to be completed.Maintaining ISS altitude uses about 7.5 tonnes of chemical fuel per annumat an annual cost of about $210 million. The Russian Orbital Segment contains the Data Management System, which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control (ROS GNC) for the entire station.Initially,Zarya, the first module of the station, controlled the station until a short time after the Russian service moduleZvezdadocked and was transferred control.Zvezdacontains the ESA built DMS-R Data Management System.Using two fault-tolerant computers (FTC),Zvezdacomputes the station's position and orbital trajectory using redundant Earth horizon sensors, Solar horizon sensors as well as Sun and star trackers. The FTCs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced fault-masking by majority voting. Zvezdauses gyroscopes (reaction wheels) and thrusters to turn itself. Gyroscopes do not require propellant; instead they use electricity to 'store' momentum in flywheels by turning in the opposite direction to the station's movement. The USOS has its own computer-controlled gyroscopes to handle its extra mass. When gyroscopes'saturate', thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum. In February 2005, during Expedition 10, an incorrect command was sent to the station's computer, using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed. When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, this can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which itself has no thrusters. Docked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude, such as for troubleshooting or during theinstallation of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics. The low altitudes at which the ISS orbits are also home to a variety of space debris,including spent rocket stages, defunct satellites, explosion fragments (including materials fromanti-satellite weapontests), paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, and coolant released byUS-Anuclear-powered satellites. These objects, in addition to naturalmicrometeoroids,are a significant threat. Objects large enough to destroy the station can be tracked, and therefore are not as dangerous as smaller debris.Objects too small to be detected by optical and radar instruments, from approximately 1 cm down to microscopic size, number in the trillions. Despite their small size, some of these objects are a threat because of theirkinetic energyand direction in relation to the station. Spacewalking crew in spacesuits are also at risk of suit damage and consequentexposure to vacuum. Ballistic panels, also called micrometeorite shielding, are incorporated into the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems. The type and thickness of these panels depend on their predicted exposure to damage. The station's shields and structure have different designs on the ROS and the USOS. On the USOS,Whipple Shieldsare used. The US segment modules consist of an inner layer made from 1.5–5.0 cm-thick (0.59–1.97 in)aluminium, a 10 cm-thick (3.9 in) intermediate layers ofKevlarand Nextel (a ceramic fabric),and an outer layer ofstainless steel, which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact. On the ROS, acarbon fibre reinforced polymerhoneycomb screen is spaced from the hull, an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that, with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering, and glass cloth over the top. Space debris is tracked remotely from the ground, and the station crew can be notified.If necessary, thrusters on the Russian Orbital Segment can alter the station's orbital altitude, avoiding the debris. TheseDebris Avoidance Manoeuvres(DAMs) are not uncommon, taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance. Ten DAMs had been performed by the end of 2009.Usually, an increase in orbital velocity of the order of 1 m/s is used to raise the orbit by one or two kilometres. If necessary, the altitude can also be lowered, although such a manoeuvre wastes propellant.If a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a DAM to be safely conducted, the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their spacecraft in order to be able to evacuate in the event the station was seriously damaged by the debris. Partial station evacuations have occurred on 13 March 2009, 28 June 2011, 24 March 2012, 16 June 2015,November 2021,and27 June 2024. The November 2021 evacuation was caused by a Russian anti-satelliteweapon test.NASA administratorBill Nelsonsaid it was unthinkable that Russia would endanger the lives of everyone on ISS, including their own cosmonauts. The ISS is visible in theskyto thenaked eyeas a visibly moving, bright white dot, when crossing the sky and being illuminated by the Sun, duringtwilight, the hours after sunset and before sunrise, when the station remains sunlit, outside ofEarth's shadow, but the ground and sky are dark.It crosses the skies at latitudes between thepolar regions.Depending on the path it takes across the sky, the time it takes the station to move across the horizon or from one to the other may be short or up to 10 minutes, while likely being only visible part of that time because of it moving into or out of Earth's shadow. It then returns around every 90 minutes, with the time of the day that it crosses the sky shifting over the course of some weeks, and therefore before returning to twilight and visible illumination. Because of the size of its reflective surface area, the ISS is the brightest artificial object in the sky (excluding othersatellite flares), with an approximate maximummagnitudeof −4 when in sunlight and overhead (similar toVenus), and a maximumangular sizeof 63 arcseconds. Tools are provided by a number of websites such asHeavens-Above(seeLive viewingbelow) as well assmartphoneapplications that useorbital dataand the observer's longitude and latitude to indicate when the ISS will be visible (weather permitting), where the station will appear to rise, the altitude above the horizon it will reach and the duration of the pass before the station disappears either by setting below the horizon or entering into Earth's shadow. In November 2012 NASA launched its "Spot the Station" service, which sends people text and email alerts when the station is due to fly above their town.The station is visible from 95% of the inhabited land on Earth, but is not visible from extreme northern or southern latitudes. Under specific conditions, the ISS can be observed at night on five consecutive orbits. Those conditions are 1) a mid-latitude observer location, 2) near the time of the solstice with 3) the ISS passing in the direction of the pole from the observer near midnight local time. The three photos show the first, middle and last of the five passes on 5–6 June 2014. Using a telescope-mounted camera to photograph the station is a popular hobby for astronomers,while using a mounted camera to photograph the Earth and stars is a popular hobby for crew.The use of a telescope or binoculars allows viewing of the ISS during daylight hours. Transitsof the ISS in front of the Sun, particularly during aneclipse(and so the Earth, Sun, Moon, and ISS are all positioned approximately in a single line) are of particular interest for amateur astronomers. Gravity at the altitude of the ISS is approximately 90% as strong as at Earth's surface, but objects in orbit are in a continuous state offreefall, resulting in an apparent state ofweightlessness.This perceived weightlessness is disturbed by five effects: The ISS is partially protected from the space environment byEarth's magnetic field. From an average distance of about 70,000 km (43,000 mi) from the Earth's surface, depending on Solar activity, themagnetospherebegins to deflectsolar windaround Earth and the space station.Solar flaresare still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial "proton storm" of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew ofExpedition 10took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the ROS designed for this purpose. Subatomic charged particles, primarilyprotonsfrom cosmic rays and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called anaurora. Outside Earth's atmosphere, ISS crews are exposed to approximately onemillisieverteach day (about a year's worth of natural exposure on Earth), resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the DNA andchromosomesoflymphocytes; being central to theimmune system, any damage to these cells could contribute to the lowerimmunityexperienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence ofcataractsin astronauts. Protective shielding and medications may lower the risks to an acceptable level. Radiation levels on the ISS are between 12 and 28.8 milli rads per day,about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other types of radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight, an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; this is one fifth the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while the ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay on board the station. Hazardous molds that can foul air and water filters may develop aboard space stations. They can produce acids that degrade metal, glass, and rubber. They can also be harmful to the crew's health. Microbiological hazards have led to a development of theLOCAD-PTS(a portable test system) which identifies common bacteria and molds faster than standard methods ofculturing, which may require a sample to be sent back to Earth.Researchers in 2018 reported, after detecting the presence of fiveEnterobacter bugandensisbacterial strains on the ISS (none of which arepathogenicto humans), that microorganisms on the ISS should be carefully monitored to continue assuring a medically healthy environment for astronauts. Contamination on space stations can be prevented by reduced humidity, and by using paint that contains mold-killing chemicals, as well as the use of antiseptic solutions. All materials used in the ISS are tested for resistance againstfungi.Since 2016, a series of ESA-sponsored experiments have been conducted to test the anti-bacterial properties of various materials, with the goal of developing "smart surfaces" that mitigate bacterial growth in multiple ways, using the best method for a particular circumstance. Dubbed "Microbial Aerosol Tethering on Innovative Surfaces" (MATISS), the programme involves deployment of small plaques containing an array of glass squares covered with different test coatings. They remain on the station for six months before being returned to earth for analysis.The most recent and final experiment of the series was launched on 5 June 2023 aboard theSpaceX CRS-28cargo mission to ISS, comprising four plaques. Whereas previous experiments in the series were limited to analysis bylight microsocopy, this experiment uses quartz glass made of pure silica, which will allowspectrographic analysis. Two of the plaques were returned after eight months and the remaining two after 16 months. In April 2019, NASA reported that a comprehensive study had been conducted into the microorganisms and fungi present on the ISS. The experiment was performed over a period of 14 months on three different flight missions, and involved taking samples from 8 predefined locations inside the station, then returning them to earth for analysis. In prior experiments, analysis was limited to culture-based methods, thus overlooking microbes which cannot be grown in culture. The present study usedmolecular-based methods in addition to culturing, resulting in a more complete catalog. The results may be useful in improving the health and safety conditions for astronauts, as well as better understanding other closed-in environments on Earth such as clean rooms used by the pharmaceutical and medical industries. Space flight is not inherently quiet, with noise levels exceeding acoustic standards as far back as theApollo missions.For this reason, NASA and the International Space Station international partners have developednoise controlandhearing lossprevention goals as part of the health program for crew members. Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.The effort includes contributions fromacoustical engineers,audiologists,industrial hygienists, and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, Roscosmos, the European Space Agency (ESA), the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). When compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels experienced by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to theOccupational Safety and Health Administration– rarely reaching 85 dBA. But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging six months in duration. These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarmaudibility. Over the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS. During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose the quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.: 5.7.3During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards. The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS. The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials,noise barriers, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels, this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducingambient noise levels. NASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from theNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthand theWorld Health Organization), in order to protect all crew members. The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits. One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need forhearing protection devices(HPDs). Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, appliesengineering controls, and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions. There have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received theSafe-In-Sound Awardfor Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise. An onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards. Ammonia is used in the external radiators of the station and could potentially leak into the pressurised modules. On 12 April 2019, NASA reported medical results from theAstronaut Twin Study. AstronautScott Kellyspent a year in space on the ISS, whilehis identical twinspent the year on Earth. Several long-lasting changes were observed, including those related to alterations inDNAandcognition, when one twin was compared with the other. In November 2019, researchers reported that astronauts experienced seriousblood flowandclotproblems while on board the ISS, based on a six-month study of 11 healthy astronauts. The results may influence long-term spaceflight, including a mission to the planet Mars, according to the researchers. There is considerable evidence thatpsychosocialstressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.CosmonautValery Ryuminwrote in his journal during a particularly difficult period on board theSalyut6space station: "All the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 [5.5 m × 6 m] and leave them together for two months." NASA's interest inpsychological stresscaused by space travel, initially studied when their crewed missions began, was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the Russian space stationMir. Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA astronautDaniel Tanidied in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child. A study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months. The ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language. First-generation space stations had crews who spoke a single language; second- and third-generation stations have crew from many cultures who speak many languages. Astronauts must speak English and Russian, and knowing additional languages is even better. Due to the lack of gravity, confusion often occurs. Even though there is no up and down in space, some crew members feel like they are oriented upside down. They may also have difficulty measuring distances. This can cause problems like getting lost inside the space station, pulling switches in the wrong direction or misjudging the speed of an approaching vehicle during docking. Thephysiologicaleffects of long-term weightlessness includemuscle atrophy, deterioration of the skeleton (osteopenia), fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, and puffiness of the face. Sleep is regularly disturbed on the ISS because of mission demands, such as incoming or departing spacecraft. Sound levels in the station are unavoidably high. The atmosphere is unable tothermosiphonnaturally, so fans are required at all times to process the air which would stagnate in the freefall (zero-G) environment. To prevent some of the adverse effects on the body, the station is equipped with: twoTVIStreadmills (including the COLBERT); theARED(Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), which enables various weightlifting exercises that add muscle without raising (or compensating for) the astronauts' reduced bone density;and a stationary bicycle. Each astronaut spends at least two hours per day exercising on the equipment.Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill. The living and working space aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is larger than a six-bedroom house, equipped with seven private sleeping quarters, three bathrooms, two dining rooms, a gym, and a panoramic 360-degree-view bay window. The station provides dedicated crew quarters for long-term crew members. Two are located inZvezda, one inNauka, and four inHarmony.These soundproof, person-sized booths offer privacy, ventilation, and basic amenities such as a sleeping bag, a reading lamp, and storage for personal items.The quarters inZvezdainclude a small window but have less ventilation and soundproofing. Visiting crew members use tethered sleeping bags attached to available wall space or inside their spacecraft. While it is possible to sleep floating freely, this is generally avoided to prevent collisions with sensitive equipment.Proper ventilation is critical, as astronauts risk oxygen deprivation if exhaled carbon dioxide accumulates in a bubble around their heads. The station's lighting system is adjustable, allowing for dimming, switching off, andcolour temperaturechanges to support crew activities and rest. The ISS operates onCoordinated Universal Time(UTC).A typical day aboard the ISS begins at 06:00 with wake-up, post-sleep routines, and a morning inspection of the station. After breakfast, the crew holds a daily planning conference with Mission Control, starting work around 08:10. Morning tasks include scheduled exercise, scientific experiments, maintenance, or operational duties. Following a one-hour lunch break at 13:05, the crew resumes their afternoon schedule of work and exercise. Pre-sleep activities, including dinner and a crew conference, begin at 19:30, with the scheduled sleep period starting at 21:30. The crew works approximately 10 hours on weekdays and 5 hours on Saturdays, with the remaining time allocated for relaxation or catching up on tasks. Free time often involves enjoying personal hobbies, communicating with family, or gazing out at Earth through the station's windows.The crew can watch TV aboard the station. When the Space Shuttle was operating, the ISS crew aligned with the shuttle crew'sMission Elapsed Time, a flexible schedule based on the shuttle's launch. To simulate night conditions, the station's windows are covered during designated sleep periods, as the ISS experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets daily due to its orbital speed. Reflection of individual and crew characteristics are found particularly in the decoration of the station and expressions in general, such as religion.The latter has produced a certain material economy between the station and Russia in particular. The micro-society of the station, as well as wider society, and possibly the emergence of distinct station cultures,is being studied by analyzing many aspects, from art to dust accumulation, as well as archaeologically how material of the ISS has been discarded. Food aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is preserved and packaged to withstand long storage times, minimize waste, and prevent contamination of station systems. Because microgravity dulls taste, meals are often seasoned more heavily than on Earth.Crews particularly look forward to resupply missions, which deliver perishable items such as fresh fruit and vegetables. To reduce the risk of crumbs and spills damaging equipment, foods are prepared in specialized packaging, liquid condiments are preferred over powdered ones, and containers are secured with Velcro or magnets. Drinks are delivered as powders to be mixed with water, while soups and beverages are sipped from plastic bags with straws.Solid foods are eaten with utensils attached to trays by magnets, and any stray food must be collected to prevent it from clogging air filters and other systems. The firstgalleywas installed inZvezda, equipped with an electro-resistive can warmer and a water dispenser for both hot and ambient water. Many Russian meals are still packaged incans, which are eaten directly, while others are provided inretort pouchesrehydrated with the water dispenser. A second galley was later added toUnityto support the station's larger crew. It contains two briefcase-shaped food warmers, a refrigerator (added in 2008), and a water dispenser.Most food in the U.S. Orbital Segment is packaged in retort pouches, which are rehydrated if necessary and heated or chilled in a food warmer or refrigerator as desired. While crews occasionally gather for group meals inUnity, especially during holidays or special occasions, they more often eat in small groups because of differing schedules. Russian cosmonauts also retain the option of dining separately inZvezda, where the can warmer is located. With the growing diversity of NASA's astronaut corps and the large number of international astronauts who have flown to the ISS, the variety of food available has expanded significantly. Efforts are made to provide meals that reflect astronauts' cultural backgrounds and personal preferences, and food is often shared among crew members. Experiments have also been conducted aboard the ISS to grow fresh vegetables in orbit.These studies aim to supplement astronauts' diets with additional nutrients, provide psychological benefits, and advance space agricultural techniques needed for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.As of 2023, crops grown include three types oflettuce,Chinese cabbage,mizuna mustard, and red Russiankale.Some of the plants are harvested and eaten by the crew, while others were returned to Earth for analysis. In the future, NASA plans to grow tomatoes andpeppers, and eventually berries, beans, and other nutrient-rich foods. Such crops could offer not only improved nutrition, but also potential protection against space radiation for crew members who consume them. The ISS is equipped with three Russian-designed toilets, located inZvezda,TranquilityandNauka.Inside these "Waste and Hygiene Compartments" the occupant fastens themselves to the toilet seat, which is equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a proper seal.A lever activates a powerful fan while opening a suction port at the bottom of the toilet bowl, and the airstream carries waste away. Solid waste is stored in individual bags placed in an aluminium container, which is later transferred to cargo spacecraft that will burn up on reentry.Liquid waste is collected through a hose with anatomically shaped funnel adapters so that both men and women can use the same system. Theurine is divertedto the Water Recovery System, where it is processed into drinking water. Showers were first introduced on space stations in the early 1970s aboardSkylabandSalyut3.: 139However, crews complained about the complexity of showering, and by the time ofSalyut 6in the early 1980s, it had been reduced to a monthly activity.The ISS, like later Russian stations after has no shower; instead, astronauts clean themselves with wet wipes or with a water jet and using soap dispensed from a toothpaste-like tube. Rinseless shampoo and edible toothpaste are also provided to conserve water. Originally the ISS was planned to be a 15-year mission.Therefore, an end of mission had been worked on,but was several times postponed due to the success and support for the operation of the station.As a result, the oldest modules of the ISS have been in orbit for more than 20 years, with their reliability having decreased.It has been proposed to use funds elsewhere instead, for example for a return to the Moon.According to theOuter Space Treaty, the parties are legally responsible for all spacecraft or modules they launch.Anunmaintained stationwould pose anorbitalandre-entryhazard. Russia has stated that it plans to pull out of the ISS program after 2025.However, Russian modules will provideorbital station-keepinguntil 2028. The US planned in 2009 to deorbit the ISS in 2016.But on 30 September 2015, Boeing's contract with NASA as prime contractor for the ISS was extended to 30 September 2020. Part of Boeing's services under the contract related to extending the station's primary structural hardware past 2020 to the end of 2028.In July 2018, the Space Frontier Act of 2018 was intended to extend operations of the ISS to 2030. This bill was unanimously approved in the Senate, but failed to pass in the U.S. House.In September 2018, the Leading Human Spaceflight Act was introduced with the intent to extend operations of the ISS to 2030, and was confirmed in December 2018.Congress later passed similar provisions in itsCHIPS and Science Act, signed into law by U.S. PresidentJoe Bidenon 9 August 2022. If until 2031Commercial LEO Destinations providersare not sufficient to accommodate NASA's projects, NASA is suggesting to extend ISS operations beyond 2031. NASA considered originally several possible disposal options: natural orbital decay with random reentry (as with Skylab), boosting the station to a higher altitude (which would delay reentry), and a controlled de-orbit targeting a remote ocean area. NASA determined that random reentry carried an unacceptable risk of producing hazardous space debris that could hit people or property and re-boosting the station would be costly and could also create hazards. Prior to 2010, plans had contemplated using a slightly modified Progress spacecraft to de-orbit the ISS. However, NASA concluded Progress would not be adequate for the job, and decided on a spacecraft specifically designed for the task. In January 2022, NASA announced a planned date of January 2031 to de-orbit the ISS using the "U.S. Deorbit Vehicle" and direct any remnants into a remote area of the South Pacific Ocean that has come to be known as thespacecraft cemetery.NASA plans to launch the deorbit vehicle in 2030, docking at the Harmony forward port.The deorbit vehicle will remain attached, dormant, for about a year as the station's orbit naturally decays to 220 km (140 mi). The spacecraft would then conduct one or more orientation burns to lower the perigee to 150 km (93 mi), followed by a final deorbiting burn. NASA began planning for the deorbit vehicle after becoming wary of Russia pulling out of the ISS abruptly, leaving the other partners with few good options for a controlled reentry.In June 2024, NASA selected SpaceX to develop the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle, a contract potentially worth $843 million. The vehicle will consist of an existingCargo Dragonspacecraft which will be paired with a significantly lengthenedtrunk modulewhich will be equipped with 46 Draco thrusters (instead of the normal 16) and will carry 30,000 kg (66,000 lb) of propellant, nearly six times the normal load. NASA is still working to secure all the necessary funding to build, launch and operate the deorbit vehicle. On 20 February 2025,Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX andSenior Advisor to President Trump, suggested in a tweet that the International Space Station be de-orbited "two years from now" as Musk believes the station has "served its purpose" and has "very little incremental utility". Despite this, no official decisions on moving up the de-orbiting date have been made yet by the president. The follow-up to NASA's program/strategy is theCommercial LEO Destinations Program, meant to allow private industry to build and maintain their own stations, and NASA procuring access as a customer, starting in 2028.Similarly, the ESA has been seeking new private space stations to provide orbital services, as well as retrieve materials, from the ISS.Axiom Stationis planned to begin as a single module temporarily hosted at the ISS in 2027.Additionally, there have been suggestions in the commercial space industry that the ISS could be converted to commercial operations after it is retired by government entities,including turning it into a space hotel. Russia previously has planned to use its orbital segment for the construction of itsOPSEKstation after the ISS is decommissioned. The modules under consideration for removal from the current ISS included the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (Nauka;MLM), launched in July 2021, and the other new Russian modules that are proposed to be attached toNauka. These newly launched modules would still be well within their useful lives in 2024.At the end of 2011, theExploration Gateway Platformconcept also proposed using leftover USOS hardware andZvezda 2as a refuelling depot and service station located at one of the Earth–MoonLagrange points. However, the entire USOS was not designed for disassembly and will be discarded. Western space industry has suggested in 2022 using the ISS as a platform to develop orbital salvage capacities, by companies such as CisLunar Industries working on using space debris as fuel,instead of plunging it into the ocean. NASA has stated that by July 2024 it has not seen any viable proposals for reuse of the ISS or parts of it. The ISS has been described as themost expensive single itemever constructed.As of 2010, the total cost was US$150 billion. This includesNASA's budget of $58.7 billion ($89.73 billion in 2021 dollars) for the station from 1985 to 2015, Russia's $12 billion, Europe's $5 billion, Japan's $5 billion, Canada's $2 billion, and the cost of 36 shuttle flights to build the station, estimated at $1.4 billion each, or $50.4 billion in total. Assuming 20,000 man-days of use from 2000 to 2015 by two- to six-person crews, each man-day would cost $7.5 million, less than half the inflation-adjusted $19.6 million ($5.5 million before inflation) per man-day ofSkylab. The ISS has become an international symbol of human capabilities, particularly human cooperation and science,defining a cooperative international approach and period, instead of a loomingcommercializedandmilitarizedinterplanetary world. Beside numerous documentaries such as the IMAX documentariesSpace Station 3Dfrom 2002,orA Beautiful Planetfrom 2016,and films likeApogee of Fear(2012)andYolki 5(2016)the ISS is the subject of feature films such asThe Day After Tomorrow(2004),Love(2011),together with the Chinese stationTiangong 1inGravity(2013),Life(2017),andI.S.S.(2023). In 2022, the movieThe Challenge(Doctor's House Call)was filmed aboard the ISS, and was notable for being the first feature film in which both professional actors and director worked together in space. The 2023 novel by English writerSamantha Harvey,Orbital, is set in the space station. It won the2024 Booker Prize Ceridwen Dovey'sOnly the Astronauts, a 2024 collection of short stories in which the narrator in each story is an inanimate object in space, includes the International Space Station. The ISS is blown up during theCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2mission "Second Sun", in which the character Captain Price launches anICBMinto the earth's atmosphere; the resulting shockwave destroys the station. The ISS is present inFar Cry New Dawnas an expedition site, having fallen to earth during anuclear war.

Space Exploration Technologies Corp., commonly referred to asSpaceX, is an Americanspace technologycompany headquartered at theStarbase development siteinStarbase, Texas.Since its founding in 2002, the company has made numerous advances inrocket propulsion,reusable launch vehicles,human spaceflightandsatellite constellationtechnology. As of 2025[update], SpaceX is the world's dominantspace launchprovider, its launch cadence eclipsing all others, including private competitors and national programs like theChinese space program.SpaceX,NASA, and theUnited States Armed Forceswork closely together by means ofgovernmental contracts. SpaceX was founded byElon Muskin 2002 with a vision of decreasing the costs of space launches, paving the way toa self-sustaining colony on Mars. In 2008,Falcon 1successfully launched into orbit after three failed launch attempts. The company then moved towards the development of the largerFalcon 9rocket and theDragon 1capsule to satisfy NASA'sCOTS contractsfor deliveries to theInternational Space Station. By 2012, SpaceX finished all COTS test flights and began deliveringCommercial Resupply Servicesmissions to the International Space Station. Also around that time, SpaceX started developing hardware to make theFalcon 9 first stage reusable. The company demonstrated thefirst successful first-stage landing in 2015andre-launch of the first stage in 2017.Falcon Heavy, built from three Falcon 9 boosters,first flew in 2018after a more than decade-long development process. As of May 2025, the company's Falcon 9 rockets have landed and flown againmore than 450 times, reaching 1–3 launches a week. These milestones delivered the company much-needed investment and SpaceX sought todiversifyits sources of income. In 2019, the first operational satellite of theStarlinkinternetsatellite constellationcame online. In subsequent years, Starlink generated the bulk of SpaceX's income and paved the way for itsStarshieldmilitary counterpart. In 2020, SpaceX began to operate itsDragon 2capsules to deliver crewed missions for NASA and private entities. Around this time, SpaceX began building test prototypes forStarship, which is the largest launch vehicle in history and aims to fully realize the company's vision of a fully reusable, cost-effective and adaptable launch vehicle. SpaceX is also developing its ownspace suitandastronautvia itsPolaris programas well as developing thehuman lander for lunar missionsunder NASA'sArtemis program.SpaceX is not publicly traded; a space industry newspaper estimated that SpaceX has a revenue of over$10 billionin 2024. In early 2001,Elon MuskmetRobert Zubrinand donated$100,000to hisMars Society, joining its board of directors for a short time.: 30–31He gave aplenary talkat their fourth convention where he announcedMars Oasis, a project to land agreenhouseand grow plants on Mars.Musk initially attempted to acquire aDneprlaunch vehicle for the project through Russian contacts fromJim Cantrell. Musk returned with his team to Moscow, this time bringingMichael Griffin, who later became the 11thAdministrator of NASA, but found the Russians increasingly unreceptive.On the flight home, Musk announced he could start a company to build the affordable rockets they needed instead.By applyingvertical integration,using inexpensivecommercial off-the-shelfcomponents when possible,and adopting themodular approachof modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch costs. In early 2002, Elon Musk started to look for staff for his company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached five people for the initial positions at the fledgling company, including Griffin, who declined the position of Chief Engineer,: 11Jim Cantrelland John Garvey (Cantrell and Garvey later founded the companyVector Launch), rocket engineerTom Mueller, and Chris Thompson.SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse inEl Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees, such asTom Mueller(CTO),Gwynne Shotwell(COO), and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations), came from neighboringTRWandBoeingcorporations. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX's early employees.: 22 Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access tospace, ultimately by a factor of ten. SpaceX developed its firstorbital launch vehicle, theFalcon 1, with internal funding.The Falcon 1 was anexpendabletwo-stage-to-orbitsmall-lift launch vehicle. The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately$90 millionto$100 million.: 215 The Falcon rocket series was named afterStar Wars'sMillennium Falconfictional spacecraft. In 2004, SpaceX protested against NASA to theGovernment Accountability Office(GAO) because of a sole-source contract awarded toKistler Aerospace. Before the GAO could respond, NASA withdrew the contract, and formed theCOTS program.: 109–110In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space program through the end of the decade, a program that would later become theDragon spacecraft.In 2006, the company was selected by NASA and awarded$396 millionto provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts to the International Space Station (ISS) under theCOTS program. The first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by theUnited States Department of Defenseunder theDARPA Falcon Projectwhich evaluated new U.S. launch vehicles suitable for use in hypersonic missile delivery forPrompt Global Strike.The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and 2008, all resulted in failures, which almost ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed, as well,and consequentlyTesla,SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same time.: 178–182Musk was reportedly "waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain" because of the stress.: 216 The financial situation started to turn around with the first successful launch achieved onthe fourth attempton September 28, 2008. Musk split his remaining$30 millionbetween SpaceX and Tesla, and NASA awarded the firstCommercial Resupply Services(CRS) contract awarding$1.6 billionto SpaceX in December, thus financially saving the company.: 217–221Based on these factors and the further business operations they enabled, the Falcon 1 was soon retired following itssecond successful, and fifth total, launchin July 2009. This allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a larger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.Gwynne Shotwellwas also promoted to company president at the time, for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract with theNASAAssociate AdministratorBill Gerstenmaier.: 222 SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, theFalcon 5.The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of theFalcon 9, areusableheavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated byNASA, which committed to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from theCommercial Orbital Transportation Services(COTS) program in 2006.The overall contract award was$278 millionto provide development funding for theDragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon.As part of this contract, the Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with theDragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft. The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboardCOTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9's second flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits, completing all its mission objectives.By December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months. In April 2011, as part of its second-roundCommercial Crew Development(CCDev) program, NASA issued a$75 millioncontract for SpaceX to develop an integratedlaunch escape systemfor Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.NASA awarded SpaceX a fixed-priceSpace Act Agreement(SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in August 2012. In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was owned by Muskand his seventy million shares were then estimated to be worth$875 milliononprivate markets,valuing SpaceX at$1.3 billion.In May 2012, with theDragon C2+launch, Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to theInternational Space Station.After the flight, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to$2.4 billionor$20/share.By that time, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately$1 billionover its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity provided approximately$200 million, with Musk investing approximately$100 millionand other investors having put in about$100 million. SpaceX's active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects of the landing technology.TheFalcon 9 prototypesperformed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL). High-velocity, high-altitude tests of theboosteratmospheric return technology began in late 2013. SpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide.That yearArianespacerequested that European governments provide additionalsubsidiesto face the competition from SpaceX.Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S. military payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S. launch providerUnited Launch Alliance(ULA).The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise to over$400 millionover the years.In September 2014, NASA's Director of Commercial Spaceflight, Kevin Crigler, awarded SpaceX the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to finalize the development of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several technical and certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after certification. In January 2015, SpaceX raised$1 billionin funding fromGoogleandFidelity Investments, in exchange for 8.33% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately$12 billion.The same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite constellation, calledStarlink, to provide global broadband internet service with 4,000 satellites. The Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the seventh ISS resupply mission,CRS-7exploded two minutes into the flight. The problem was traced to a failed two-foot-long steel strut that held aheliumpressure vessel, which broke free due to the force ofacceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressurepropellant tank, causing the failure. SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015 withFalcon 9 Flight 20.In April 2016, the company achieved the first successful landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS)Of Course I Still Love Youin the Atlantic Ocean.By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage. A second major rocket failure happened in early September 2016, when a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill operation for a standard pre-launchstatic fire test. The payload, theAMOS-6communications satellite valued at$200 million, was destroyed.The explosion was caused by theliquid oxygenthat is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and ignited withcarbon compositehelium vessels.Though not considered an unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017. In March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for theSES-10satellite. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.The first stage was recovered again, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket. In July 2017, the company raised$350 million, which raised its valuation to$21 billion.In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts.By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about$12 billionin contract revenue.The contracts included both commercial andgovernment(NASA/DOD) customers.This made SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches. In 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary,The Boring Company,and began work to construct a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, using a small number of SpaceX employees,which was completed in May 2018,and opened to the public in December 2018.During 2018, The Boring Company wasspun outinto a separatecorporate entitywith 6% of the equity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk. In 2019 SpaceX raised$1.33 billionof capital across three funding rounds.By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to$33.3 billionand reached$36 billionby March 2020. On August 19, 2020, after a$1.9 billionfunding round, one of the largest single fundraising pushes by any privately held company, SpaceX's valuation increased to$46 billion. In February 2021, SpaceX raised an additional$1.61 billionin an equity round from 99 investorsat a per share value of approximately$420,raising the company valuation to approximately$74 billion. By 2021, SpaceX had raised more than$6 billionin equity financing. Most of the capital raised since 2019 has been used to support the operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the development and manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle.By October 2021, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to$100.3 billion.On April 16, 2021, Starship HLS won a contract to play a critical role in the NASA crewed spaceflightArtemis program.By 2021, SpaceX had entered into agreements withGoogle Cloud PlatformandMicrosoft Azureto provide on-ground computer and networking services forStarlink.A new round of financing in 2022 valued SpaceX at$127 billion. In July 2021, SpaceX unveiled another drone ship namedA Shortfall of Gravitas, landing a booster fromCRS-23on it for the first time on August 29, 2021.Within the first 130 days of 2022, SpaceX had 18 rocket launches and two astronaut splashdowns. On December 13, 2021, company CEOElon Muskannounced that the company was starting acarbon dioxide removalprogram that wouldconvert captured carbonintorocket fuel,after he announced a$100 milliondonation to theX Prize Foundationthe previous February to provide the monetary rewards to winners in a contest to develop the bestcarbon capture technology. In August 2022,Reutersreported that theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) began initial discussions with SpaceX that could lead to the company's launchers being used temporarily, given that Russia blocked access toSoyuzrockets amid theRussian invasion of Ukraine.Since that invasion and in the greater war between Russia and Ukraine, Starlinkwas extensively used. In 2022, SpaceX's Falcon 9 also became the world record holder for the most launches of a single vehicle type in a single year.[non-primary source needed]SpaceX launched a rocket approximately every six days in 2022, with 61 launches in total. All but one (a Falcon Heavy in November) was on a Falcon 9 rocket. In November 2023, SpaceX announced it would acquire its parachute supplierPioneer Aerospaceout of bankruptcy for$2.2 million. On July 16, 2024, Elon Musk posted onXthat SpaceX would move its headquarters fromHawthorne, California, toSpaceX StarbaseinBrownsville, Texas. Musk said this was because the recently passed CaliforniaAB1955 bill"and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies".This new law in California bans school districts from requiring that teachers notify parents about changes to a student's sexual orientation and gender identity.The headquarters officially moved toBrownsville, Texasin August 2024, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State.The move to relocate SpaceX's headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term. The Hawthorne facility continues to support the company's Falcon launch vehicles, which was SpaceX's workhorse product in 2024. SpaceX's 2024Polaris Dawnmission featured the first-ever private spacewalk, marking a major milestone in commercial space exploration. In 2025,ProPublicareported that Chinese investors were investing in SpaceX via offshore entities, such as theCayman Islands. Experts speculated that this might raise national security concerns with regulators.Later in 2025 ProPublica reported that Chinese equity ownership in SpaceX likely extended to direct investment, citing the court testimony of investor Iqbaljit Kahlon. By July 2025, as part of $5 Billion equity raise SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion inxAI. In January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance theStarshipandStarlinkprojects.The purpose of the Starship vehicle is to enable large-scale transit of humans and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.SpaceX's Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, with a planned payload capacity of 100+ tons.Construction of initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing moved to the newSpaceX South Texas launch sitelater that year. On April 20, 2023, Starship'sfirst orbital flight testended in a mid-air explosion over theGulf of Mexicobefore booster separation. After launch, multiple engines in the booster progressively failed, causing the vehicle to reachmaxqlater than planned. "Max q" is the theoretical point of maximal mechanical stress which occurs during the launch sequence of a space vehicle. In the case of a rocket that must be self-destructed during its ascent, max q occurs at the point of self-destruction. Eventually, the vehicle lost control and spun erratically until the automatedflight termination systemwas activated, which intentionally destroyed the rocket. Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other individuals familiar with the space industry have referred to the test flight as a success. Musk said at the time that it would take "six to eight weeks" to get the infrastructure prepared for another launch. In October 2023, a senior SpaceX executive stated the company had been ready to launch the next test flight since September. He accused government regulators of disrupting the project's progress, adding the delay could lead to China beating U.S. astronauts back to the Moon. On November 18, 2023, SpaceX launched Starship on itssecond flight test, with both vehicles flying for a few minutes before separately exploding. In early March 2024 SpaceX announced that it was targeting March 14 as the tentative launch date for its next uncrewed Starship launch configuration flight test, pending the issuance of a "launch license" by theFAA. This license was granted on March 13, 2024.On March 14, 2024, at 13:25 UTC,Starship launched for the third timeand for the first time Starship reached its planned suborbital trajectory. The flight ended with the booster experiencing a malfunction shortly before landing and the ship being lost during re-entry over the Indian Ocean. On June 4, 2024, SpaceX received the launch license forStarship's fourth flight test. The licensure itself was notable in that it was the first time that the FAA included a clause that would allow SpaceX to launch subsequent test flights without a mishap investigation, provided that they met a similar launch profile and used the same specification of hardware. The provision could prove to speed the development timeline. On October 12, 2024, SpaceX received FAA approval forStarship's fifth flight test.The flight was the first without engine failures, and the first successful tower catch. SpaceX launched Starship on itssixth flight teston November 19, 2024.The booster aborted the catch attempt, while the ship conducted a relight in space. On January 16, 2025, SpaceX launched Starship on itsseventh flight test, with the first Block 2 Ship, Ship 33 (standing at 403 ft or 123 meters). This test also carried a demonstration payload, a Starlink V3 simulator. The test launched at 22:37 UTC. The test resulted in the second catch of the Super Heavy booster, B14, but  after 8 minutes, SpaceX lost contact with 'Ship', which is the upper stage of the Starship which resulted in the failure of the ship during the ascent. The spacecraft reportedly exploded around 8.5 minutes after launch over the Atlantic Ocean near theTurks and Caicos Islands. The FAA, on January 18, required a mishap investigation of the failure. On March 7, 2025, SpaceX launched another Starship rocket, this time from Texas. Contact was lost minutes into the test flight and the spacecraft came tumbling down and broke apart, with wreckage seen across Florida's skies.As per preliminary investigation, Starship’s 7th test flight was disrupted by an oxygen leak, flashes and sustained fires in its aft section, which caused the rocket’s engines to shut down and turn on the spacecraft’s self-destruct system. On June 18, 2025, a SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during a static fire test at the company’s Starbase facility in Texas, following what the company described as a “major anomaly”. A significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug HurleyandBob Behnken) into orbit on aCrew Dragonspacecraft duringCrew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch from American soil in 9 years.The mission launched fromKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A(LC-39A) in Florida. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first large batch of 60 Starlink satellites, beginning to deploy what would become the world's largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.In 2022, most SpaceX launches focused on Starlink, a consumer internet business that sends batches of internet-beaming satellites and now has over 6,000 satellites in orbit. On July 16, 2021, SpaceX entered an agreement to acquireSwarm Technologies, a private company building alow Earth orbitsatellite constellation for communications withInternet of things(IoT) devices, for$524 million. In December 2022, the U.S.Federal Communications Commission(FCC) approved the launch of up to 7,500 of SpaceX's next-generation satellites in its Starlink internet network. In September 2025, SpaceX said it would purchase the rights to use some ofEchoStar's spectrum for $17 billion in a cash and stock deal. The company said it would use the spectrum as a foundation for Starlink's direct-to-cell business around the globe. SpaceX has developed three launch vehicles. The small-liftFalcon 1was the first launch vehicle developed and was retired in 2009. The medium-liftFalcon 9and the heavy-liftFalcon Heavyare both operational. Falcon 1was a small rocket capable of placing several hundred kilograms intolow Earth orbit. It launched five times between 2006 and 2009, of which two were successful.The Falcon 1 was the first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit. Falcon 9is amedium-lift launch vehiclecapable of delivering up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265lb) to orbit, competing with theDelta IVand theAtlas Vrockets, as well as other launch providers around the world. It has nineMerlinengines in its first stage. TheFalcon 9 v1.0rocket successfully reached orbit on its first attempt on June 4, 2010. Its third flight,COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on May 22, 2012, and launched the firstcommercialspacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).The vehicle was upgraded toFalcon 9 v1.1in 2013,Falcon 9 Full Thrustin 2015, and finally toFalcon 9 Block 5in 2018. The first stage of Falcon 9 is designed to retro propulsively land, be recovered, and flown again. Falcon Heavyis aheavy-lift launch vehiclecapable of delivering up to 63,800kg (140,700lb) toLow Earth orbit(LEO) or 26,700kg (58,900lb) togeosynchronous transfer orbit(GTO). It uses three slightly modified Falcon 9 first-stage cores with a total of 27Merlin 1Dengines.The Falcon Heavy successfully flew its inaugural mission on February 6, 2018, launching Musk's personalTesla Roadsterintoheliocentric orbit. Both the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are certified to conduct launches for theNational Security Space Launch(NSSL).As of October 28, 2025, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been launched 565 times, resulting in 562 full mission successes, one partial success, andone in-flight failure. In addition, a Falcon 9 experienceda pre-flight failurebefore a static fire test in 2016. SpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known asStarship. It comprises a reusable first stage, calledSuper Heavy, and the reusableStarship second stagespace vehicle. As of 2017[update], the system was intended to supersede the company's existing launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s. Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed severalrocket engines–Merlin,Kestrel, andRaptor– for use inlaunch vehicles,Dracofor thereaction control systemof the Dragon series of spacecraft,andSuperDracofor abort capability inCrew Dragon. Merlin is a family of rocket engines that usesliquid oxygen(LOX) andRP-1propellants. Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1's first stage and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.Kestrel uses the same propellants and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second-stage main engine. Draco andSuperDracoarehypergolicliquid-propellant rocket engines. Draco engines are used on thereaction control systemof theDragonandDragon 2spacecraft.TheSuperDracoengine is more powerful, and eight SuperDraco engines providelaunch escape capabilityfor crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft during an abort scenario. Raptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquidmethane-fueledfull-flow staged combustion cycleengines to power the first and second stages of the in-developmentStarshiplaunch system.Development versions were test-fired in late 2016,and the engine flew for the first time in 2019, powering theStarhoppervehicle to an altitude of 20 m (66 ft). SpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space Station (ISS). The first-generationDragon 1spacecraft was used only for cargo operations. It was developed with financial support from NASA under theCommercial Orbital Transportation Services(COTS) program. After a successful COTS demonstration flight in 2010, SpaceX was chosen to receive aCommercial Resupply Services(CRS) contract. The currently operational second-generationDragon 2spacecraft conductedits first flight, without crew, to the ISS in early 2019, followed bya crewed flightof Dragon 2 in 2020.It was developed with financial support from NASA under theCommercial Crew Programprogram. Thecargo variant of Dragon 2flew for the first time in December 2020, for a resupply to the ISS as part of the CRS contract with NASA. In March 2020 SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL, designed as a resupply spacecraft for NASA's plannedLunar Gatewayspace station under aGateway Logistics Services(GLS) contract.Dragon XL is planned to launch on theFalcon Heavy, and is able to transport over 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) to the Gateway. Dragon XL will be docked at the Gateway for six to twelve months at a time. SpaceX designed a spacesuitto be worn inside the Dragon spacecraft to protect from possible depressurization.On May 4, 2024, SpaceX unveiled a second spacesuit designed forextravehicular activity, planned to be used for aspacewalkduring thePolaris Dawnmission. SpaceX routinely returns thefirst stageof Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches. The rocket lands at a predetermined landing site using only its propulsion systems.When propellant margins do not permit a return to a launch site (RTLS), rockets return to a floating landing platform in the ocean, calledautonomous spaceport drone ships(ASDS). SpaceX also had plans to introducefloating launch platforms, which would be modified oil rigs provide a sea launch option for theirStarshiplaunch vehicle. As of February 2023, SpaceX had sold the oil rigs, but had not ruled out sea-based platforms for future use. Starlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of SpaceX,that consists of thousands of cross-linkedcommunications satellitesin ~550km orbits. Its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband capabilities.Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on the SpaceXPaz satellitemission in 2017. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites aboard a Falcon 9.Initial test operation of the constellation began in late 2020and first orders were taken in early 2021.Customers were told to expect internet service speeds of 50 Mbit/s to 150 Mbit/s and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms.In December 2022, Starlink reached over 1 million subscribers worldwide. The planned large number ofStarlinksatellites has been criticized by astronomers due to concerns overlight pollution,with the brightness of Starlink satellites in both optical and radio wavelengths interfering with scientific observations.In response, SpaceX has implemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness.The large number of satellites employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers ofspace debris collisions.However, the satellites are equipped withkrypton-fueledHall thrusterswhich allow them tode-orbitat the end of their life. They are also designed to autonomously avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data. In December 2022, SpaceX announcedStarshield, a program to incorporate military or government entity payloads on board a Starlink-derived satellite bus. TheSpace Development Agencyis a key customer procuring satellites for a space-basedmissile defensesystem. In June 2024, SpaceX introduced a compact version of its Starlink antennas, the "Starlink Mini", designed for mobile satellite internet use. Offered for$599in an early access release, it was more expensive than the base model. The Mini antenna, half the size and one-third the weight of the Standard version, featured a built-inWiFi router, lower power consumption, and over 100 Mbit/s download speeds. In June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would sponsor aHyperloop competition, and would build a 1.6 km (0.99 mi) longsubscaletest track near SpaceX's headquarters for the competitive events.The company held the annual competition from 2017 to 2019. In collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in the creation of aCOVID-19antibody-testing program in 2020. As such, 4300 employees volunteered to provide blood samples resulting in apeer-reviewedscientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection against the virus. In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build amini-submarineto assist therescue of children stuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand.Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's involvement "distracted from the rescue effort".Engineers at SpaceX andThe Boring Companybuilt the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9liquid oxygentransfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn't practical for the rescue mission. SpaceX is headquartered at theSpaceX StarbasenearBrownsville, Texas, where it manufactures and launches its Starship vehicle. However most of the company's operations are based out of its office inHawthorne, Californiawhere it was previously headquartered, where it builds Falcon rockets and Dragon spacecraft, and where it houses its mission control. The company also operates a Starlink satellite manufacturing facilities in Redmond, Washington, arocket development and test facilityinMcGregor, Texas,and maintains an office in the Washington, D.C. area, close to key government customers. SpaceX has two active launch sites in Florida, one active launch site in California and one active launch site at Starbase in Texas. SpaceX operates a large facility in the Los Angeles suburb ofHawthorne, California. The three-story building, originally built byNorthrop Corporationto buildBoeing 747fuselages,houses SpaceX's office space, mission control, and Falcon 9 manufacturing facilities. The area has one of the largest concentrations of space sector headquarters, facilities, and subsidiaries in the U.S., includingBoeing/McDonnell Douglasmain satellite building campuses,The Aerospace Corporation,Raytheon, NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory,United States Space Force'sSpace Systems CommandatLos Angeles Air Force Base,Lockheed Martin,BAE Systems,Northrop Grumman, andAECOM, etc., with a large pool of aerospace engineers and recent college engineering graduates. SpaceX uses a high degree ofvertical integrationin the production of its rockets and rocket engines.SpaceX builds itsrocket engines,rocket stages,spacecraft, principalavionicsand allsoftwarein-house in their Hawthorne facility, which is unusual for the space industry. The Hawthorne facility was SpaceX's headquarters until August 2024. However, the move to relocate SpaceX's headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term, as the facility will remain to the company's operations. SpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from theSpaceX StarbaseinBoca ChicanearBrownsville, Texas, having announced first plans for the launch facility in August 2014.TheFederal Aviation Administration(FAA) issued the permit in July 2014.SpaceX broke ground on the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up in the latter half of 2015,with the firstsuborbitallaunches from the facility in 2019and orbital launches starting in 2023. SpaceX has faced increased scrutiny over the environmental impact of its Starbase facility.In August 2024, theTexas Commission on Environmental Qualitycited SpaceX for violating environmental regulations by repeatedly releasing pollutants into water near the Boca Chica launch site.TheEPAfined SpaceX approximately$150,000for allegedly discharging "industrial wastewater" and violating theClean Water Act. SpaceX's Rocket Development and Test Facility inMcGregor, Texasis arocket engine test facility. Every rocket engine and thruster manufactured by SpaceX must pass through McGregor for final testing being used on flight missions.The facility also serves as a testing ground for various components and engines during theresearch and developmentprocess.In addition to engine testing, after splashdown and recovery,Dragon spacecraftmake a stop at McGregor to have their hazardoushypergolic propellantfuels removed, before the capsules continue on to Hawthorne for refurbishment. SpaceX calls the facility the most advanced and active rocket engine test facility in the world, and said that as of 2024[update], over 7,000 tests had been conducted at the facility since it opened, with seven engine test fires on a typical day, across more than a dozen test stands.Despite its low-profile compared to the company's other facilities, is a critical part of SpaceX's operations, and company president and COOGwynne Shotwellmaintains her primary office in McGregor. Originally the site of theBluebonnet Ordnance Plantduring World War II,the facility was later used byBeal Aerospacebefore being leased by SpaceX in 2003.The company has since expanded it significantly from 256 acres (104 ha) in 2003to 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) by 2015.In July 2021, SpaceX announced plans to build a second production facility for Raptor engines at McGregor. This expansion is expected to significantly increase SpaceX's production capacity, with the goal of producing 800 to 1,000 Raptor engines per year. SpaceX'sStarlinksubsidiary operates over two main facilities. Satellite manufacturing takes place nearSeattle, Washington while user terminal manufacturing takes place nearAustin, Texas. Starlink's satellite development and manufacturing operations campus occupies over 314,000 square feet (29,200 m2) in at least six buildings located inRedmond, Washington, east of Seattle. The first building opened in early 2015,and the company later expanded into five buildings on the Redmond Ridge Corporate Center. Starlink opened a user terminal manufacturing facility just outside ofBastrop, Texas, east of Austin in December 2023. In its first nine months of operation, the one-million-square-foot (93,000 m2) facility produced one million user terminals and was on track to become the largest factory forprinted circuit boardsin the United States. SpaceX operates fourorbitallaunch sites, atCape Canaveral Space Force StationandKennedy Space Centerin Florida andVandenberg Space Force Basein California for Falcon rockets, andStarbasenearBrownsville, Texasfor Starship. SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad.The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral and Kennedy enable orbits of medium inclination (28.5–55°).Larger inclinations, includingSSO, are possible from Florida by overflying Cuba. Before it was retired, allFalcon 1launches took place at theRonald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test SiteonOmelek Islandof theMarshall Islands. In April 2007,the Pentagonapproved the use ofCape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40(SLC-40) by SpaceX.The site has been used since 2010 for Falcon 9 launches, mainly to low Earth and geostationary orbits. The formerLaunch Complex 13at Cape Canaveral, now renamedLanding Zones 1 and 2, has since 2015 been used for Falcon 9first-stage booster landings.Later on, SpaceX will retire these two landing zones and add threelanding zonesforFalcon 9andFalcon Heavyrockets to conduct to "Return-to-launch-site" landings, two at LC-39A and one at SLC-40. Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 4(SLC-4E) was leased from the military in 2011 and is used for payloads to polar orbits. The Vandenberg site can launch both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles,but cannot launch to low inclination orbits. The neighboring SLC-4W was converted toLanding Zone 4in 2015 for booster landings. On April 14, 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease forKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A.The pad was subsequently modified to supportFalcon 9andFalcon Heavylaunches. As of 2024[update]it is the only pad that supports Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX launched itsfirst crewed missionto the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on May 30, 2020.Pad 39A has been prepared since 2019 to eventually accommodate Starship launches. With delays in launch FAA permits for Boca Chica, Texas, the 39A Starship preparation was accelerated in 2022. SpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts fromNASAfor the International Space Station (ISS) with technology the company developed. SpaceX is also certified forU.S. militarylaunches ofEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads. With approximately thirty missions on the manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represented over$12 billionunder contract. In 2006, SpaceX won a NASACommercial Orbital Transportation Services(COTS) Phase 1 contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to the ISS, with a possible contract option for crew transport.Through this contract, designed by NASA to provide "seed money" through Space Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid SpaceX$396 millionto develop the cargo configuration of the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9 launch vehicle with their resources.TheseSpace Act Agreementshave been shown to have saved NASA millions of dollars in development costs, making rocket development 4–10 times less expensive than if produced by NASA alone. In December 2010, with the launch of theSpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1mission, SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft.Dragon successfully berthed with the ISS duringSpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2in May 2012, a first for aprivate spacecraft. Commercial Resupply Services(CRS) is a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for the delivery of cargo and supplies to the ISS on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded$1.6 billionto SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016.SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed, and remained on station for 20 days, beforere-entering the atmosphereand splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX, and then extended the contract further for a total of twenty cargo missions to the ISS.The final Dragon 1 mission,SpaceX CRS-20, departed the ISS in April 2020, andDragonwas subsequently retired from service. Asecond phaseof contracts was awarded in January 2016 with SpaceX as one of the awardees. SpaceX will fly up to nine additional CRS flights with the upgradedDragon 2spacecraft.In March 2020, NASA contracted SpaceX to develop theDragon XLspacecraft to send supplies to theLunar Gatewayspace station. Dragon XL will be launched on a Falcon Heavy. SpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA astronauts to and from the ISS. The NASA contracts started as part of the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially operated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to the ISS. The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in 2011,followed by another in 2012 to continue development and testing of itsDragon 2spacecraft. In September 2014, NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing as the two companies that would be funded to develop systems to transport U.S. crews to and from the ISS.SpaceX won$2.6 billionto complete and certify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts called for at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA astronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon received NASA human-spaceflight certification, the contract required SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station. SpaceX completed the first key flight test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, aPad Abort Test, in May 2015,and successfully conducted a full uncrewed test flight in early 2019. The capsule docked to the ISS and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.In January 2020, SpaceX conducted anin-flight abort test, the last test flight before flying crew, in which the Dragon spacecraft fired its launch escape engines in a simulated abort scenario. On May 30, 2020, theCrew Dragon Demo-2mission was launched to theInternational Space Stationwith NASA astronautsBob BehnkenandDoug Hurley, the first time a crewed vehicle had launched from the U.S. since 2011, and the first SpaceX commercial crewed launch to the ISS.TheCrew-1mission was successfully launched to the International Space Station on November 16, 2020, withNASAastronautsMichael Hopkins,Victor GloverandShannon Walkeralong withJAXAastronautSoichi Noguchi,all members of theExpedition 64crew.On April 23, 2021,Crew-2was launched to the International Space Station with NASA astronautsShane KimbroughandK. Megan McArthur, JAXA astronautAkihiko Hoshide, andESAastronautThomas Pesquet.The Crew-2 mission successfully docked on April 24, 2021. SpaceX also offers paidcrewed spaceflightsfor private individuals. The first of these missions,Inspiration4, launched in 2021 on behalf ofShift4 PaymentsCEOJared Isaacman. The mission launched theCrew DragonResiliencefrom the FloridaKennedy Space Center'sLaunch Complex 39Aatop aFalcon 9launch vehicle, placed the Dragoncapsuleintolow Earth orbit, and ended successfully about three days later when theResiliencesplashed down in the Atlantic Ocean. All four crew members received commercial astronaut training from SpaceX. The training included lessons in orbital mechanics, operating in a microgravity environment, stress testing, emergency-preparedness training, and mission simulations. In 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded anIndefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity(IDIQ) contract, allowing theUnited States Air Forceto purchase up to$100 millionworth of launches from the company.Three years later,NASAannounced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract to SpaceX for up to$1 billion, depending on the number of missions awarded.In December 2012, SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with theUnited States Department of Defense(DoD). The United States Air ForceSpace and Missile Systems Centerawarded SpaceX two EELV-class missions:Deep Space Climate Observatory(DSCOVR) andSpace Test Program 2(STP-2). DSCOVR was launched on aFalcon 9launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on aFalcon Heavyon June 25, 2019. TheFalcon 9 v1.1was certified forNational Security Space Launch(NSSL) in 2015, allowing SpaceX to contract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security.This broke the monopoly held since 2006 byUnited Launch Alliance(ULA) over U.S. Air Force launches of classified payloads.In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch to SpaceX to launch the secondGPS IIIsatellite for$82.7 million.This was approximately 40% less than the estimated cost for similar previous missions.SpaceX also launched the third GPS III launch on June 20, 2020.In March 2018, SpaceX secured an additional$290 millioncontract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three GPS III satellites. The U.S.National Reconnaissance Office(NRO) also purchased launches from SpaceX, with the first taking place on May 1, 2017.In February 2019, SpaceX secured a$297 millioncontract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three national security missions, all slated to launch no earlier than FY 2021.In August 2020, theU.S. Space Forceawarded its National Security Space Launch (NSSL) contracts for the following 5–7 years. SpaceX won a contract for$316 millionfor one launch. In addition, SpaceX will handle 40% of the U.S. military's satellite launch requirements over the period. SpaceX also designs and launchescustom military satellitesfor theSpace Development Agencyas part of a new missile defense system in low Earth orbit.The constellation would give the United States capabilities to sense, target and potentially intercept nuclear missiles and hypersonic weapons launched from anywhere on Earth.Both China and Russia brought concerns to the United Nations about the program,and various organizations warn it could be destabilizing and trigger anarms racein space. In March 2024, Reuters reported that, as part of a$1.8 billioncontract signed with the National Reconnaissance Office in 2021, SpaceX is building a network of hundreds ofspy satellites. This new network, Reuters reported, would be able to operate as a swarm in low orbits. In December 2024, WSJ reported that Musk didn't have access to government secrets. SpaceX's low launch prices, especially forcommunications satellitesflying togeostationary transfer orbit(GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices.Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying theAriane 5) andInternational Launch Services(flying theProton).With a published price of$56.5 millionper launch tolow Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the least expensive in the industry.European satellite operators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of theAriane 5andAriane 6rockets as a result of competition from SpaceX. SpaceX ended the United Launch Alliance (ULA) monopoly of U.S. military payloads when it began to compete for national security launches. In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders.To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half. Congressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASASpace Act Agreementprocess of "setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially lower cost. According to NASA's own independently verified numbers, SpaceX's total development cost for the Falcon 9 rocket, including the Falcon 1 rocket, was estimated at$390 million. In 2011, NASA estimated that it would have cost the agency about$4 billionto develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA's traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.In May 2020, NASA administratorJim Bridenstineremarked that thanks to NASA's investments into SpaceX, the United States has 70% of the commercial launch market, a major improvement since 2012 when there were no commercial launches from the country. As of 2024, SpaceX operates a Rideshare and Bandwagon (mid inclination) programs. This provides additional competition for small satellite launchers. In November 2022, the company announced COO Gwynne Shotwell and vice presidentMark Juncosawould oversee Starbase, its Texas launch facility, along with Omead Afshar, who at the time oversaw operations for Tesla in Texas. Shyamal Patel, who was senior director of operations at the site, would shift to its Cape Canaveral site.CNBCreported that these executive moves demonstrated "the sense of urgency within the company to get Starship flying". According to The New York Times, SpaceX has likely paid little to no federal income taxes due totax loss deferralof up to $5.4bn in deferred losses, but has privately told investors that it may never realize some or all of those losses. According to former NASA deputy administratorLori Garver, the company overall has a male-dominated employee culture,  similar to that of the spaceflight industry in general.In December 2021, claims of workplace sexual harassment from five former SpaceX employees, ranging from interns to full engineers, were published.The former employees claimed to have experienced unwanted advances and uncomfortable interactions.Additionally, the accounts included claims of a culture ofsexual harassmentexisting at the company and one where complaints made to executives, managers, and human resources officers went largely unaddressed. In May 2022, a Business Insider article alleged that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct with a SpaceX flight attendant in a private jet in 2016 citing an anonymous friend of the flight attendant.In response, some employees collaborated on an open letter condemning "Elon's harmful Twitter behavior".It also asks the company to clearly define SpaceX's "no-asshole" and "zero tolerance" policies, which it says is unequally enforced from one employee to the next. The next day, Gwynne Shotwell announced that those employees who were involved with the letter had been terminated and claimed that unsponsored, unsolicited surveys were sent to employees during the work day and that some felt pressured to sign the letter. The company has also been described as having a work culture that pushes employees to work excessively and is described as fostering aburnoutculture.According to a memo byBlue Origin, a rival aerospace company with a history of lawsuits and anti-SpaceX political lobbying,SpaceX expected very long work hours, work on weekends, and limited use of holidays. "SpaceX employees say they’re paying the price for the billionaire’s push to colonize space at breakneck speed" reported Reuters in 2023. An examination of OSHA's records revealed injury rates higher than the industry's averages. In addition, Reuters documented at least 600 previously unreported workplace injuries at SpaceX, including "crushed limbs, amputations, electrocutions, head and eye wounds and one death."The person who died was Lonnie LeBlanc, a former United States Marine. In June 2024, eight ex-employees, the same who had previously been fired for penning the open letter against Elon Musk, filed a lawsuit against Musk and SpaceX alleging sexual harassment and discrimination.The lawsuit has since stalled on headquarter jurisdiction grounds. In August 2023, theU.S. Department of Justice(DOJ) filed a lawsuit against SpaceX for discriminating againstrefugeesandasylum seekersin its hiring process, alleging that the company violated theImmigration and Nationality Actby rejecting refugees and asylum recipients and hiring only U.S. citizens andpermanent residents.SpaceX denied wrongdoing, citing U.S.export controllaw.In February 2025, the DOJ filed a motion to dismiss the casewith prejudice. In December 2024, federal agencies investigated SpaceX for security violations as well as Musk's alleged drug use. According to an investigation conducted by NPR, "SpaceX has sometimes ignored environmental regulations as it rushed to fulfill its founder’s vision. With each of its launches, records show, the company discharged tens of thousands of gallons of what regulators classify as industrial wastewater into the surrounding environment."In addition to endangering nearby people, the wastewater poses significant threats to wildlife. The 2025 SpaceX Starship Flight 7 rocket explosion sent debris into the atmosphere that was spread across the Caribbean Sea. The incident also "released significant amounts of harmful air pollution into the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere."

Junois aNASAspace probe orbiting the planetJupiter. Built byLockheed Martinand operated by NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory, the spacecraft was launched fromCape Canaveral Air Force Stationon August 5, 2011UTC, as part of theNew Frontiers program.Junoentered apolar orbitof Jupiter on July 5, 2016, UTC,to begin a scientific investigation of the planet.After completing its mission,Junowas originally planned to be intentionally deorbited into Jupiter's atmosphere,but has since been approved to continue orbiting until contact is lost with the spacecraft,but it is scheduled to be shut down per the FY2026 budget proposed by the second Donald Trump administration.However, if Juno mission receives a third mission extension, it will continue to explore Jupiter for another three years to studyJovian ringsandinner moonsarea which is not well explored;this phase will also include close flybys of the moonsThebe,Amalthea,Adrastea, andMetis. Juno'smission is to measure Jupiter's composition,gravitational field,magnetic field, andpolar magnetosphere. It also searches for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere,mass distribution, and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 620 km/h (390 mph). Junois the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear poweredGalileoorbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all earlier spacecraft sent to theouter Solar Systemand beyond—which usedradioisotope thermoelectric generatorsfor power—Junois powered by solar panels, more commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in theinner Solar System.Accordingly,Junorequired the three largest solar panel wings ever deployed on a planetary probe (at the time of launching). These play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft as well as generating power. Juno'sname comes fromGreek and Roman mythology. The godJupiterdrew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief, and his wife, the goddessJuno, was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature. A NASA compilation of mission names and acronyms referred to the mission by thebackronymJupiter Near-polar Orbiter.However the project itself has consistently described it as a name with mythological associationsand not an acronym. The spacecraft's current name is in reference to the Roman goddessJuno.Junois sometimes called theNew Frontiers 2as the second mission in the New Frontiers program,but is not to be confused withNew Horizons 2, a proposed but unselected New Frontiers mission. Junowas selected on June 9, 2005, as the next New Frontiers mission afterNew Horizons.The desire for a Jupiter probe was strong in the years prior to this, but there had not been any approved missions.TheDiscovery Programhad passed over the somewhat similar but more limited Interior Structure and Internal Dynamical Evolution of Jupiter (INSIDE Jupiter) proposal,and the turn-of-the-century eraEuropa Orbiterwas canceled in 2002.The flagship-levelEuropa Jupiter System Missionwas in the works in the early 2000s, but funding issues resulted in it evolving into ESA'sJupiter Icy Moons Explorer. Junocompleted a five-year cruise to Jupiter, arriving on July 5, 2016.The spacecraft traveled a total distance of roughly 2.8×10^9km (19 AU; 1.7×10^9mi) to reach Jupiter.The spacecraft was designed to orbit Jupiter 37 times over the course of its mission. This was originally planned to take 20 months. Juno'strajectory used agravity assistspeed boost from Earth, accomplished by an Earth flyby in October 2013, two years after its launch on August 5, 2011.The spacecraft performed an orbit insertion burn to slow it enough to allow capture. It was expected to make three 53-day orbits before performing another burn on December 11, 2016, that would bring it into a 14-daypolar orbitcalled the Science Orbit. Because of a suspected problem inJuno'smain engine, the burn scheduled on December 11, 2016, was cancelled andJunoremained in its 53-day orbit until the firstGanymedeencounter of its Extended Mission.This extended mission began with a flyby of Ganymede on June 7, 2021.Subsequent flybys of Europa and thenIodecreased the orbital period to 33 days by February 2024. During the science mission,infraredandmicrowaveinstruments will measure the thermal radiation emanating from deep withinJupiter's atmosphere. These observations will complement previous studies of its composition by assessing the abundance and distribution of water, and therefore oxygen. This data will provide insight into Jupiter's origins.Junowill also investigate theconvectionthat drives natural circulation patterns in Jupiter's atmosphere. Other instruments aboardJunowill gather data about its gravitational field and polarmagnetosphere. TheJunomission was planned to conclude in February 2018 after completing 37 orbits of Jupiter, but now has been commissioned through 2025 to do a further 42 additional orbits of Jupiter as well as close flybys of Ganymede, Europa and Io.The probe was then intended to bedeorbitedand burnt up in Jupiter's outer atmosphereto avoid any possibility of impact and biological contamination of one of its moons. Junowas launched atop anAtlas V(551 configuration) atCape Canaveral Air Force Station(CCAFS),Floridaon August 5, 2011, 16:25:00 UTC. The Atlas V (AV-029) used a Russian-builtRD-180main engine, powered bykeroseneandliquid oxygen. The main engine ignited and underwent checkout then, 3.8 seconds later, the five strap-onsolid rocket boosters(SRBs) ignited. Following the SRB burnout, about 93 seconds into the flight, two of the spent boosters fell away from the vehicle, followed 1.5 seconds later by the remaining three. When heating levels had dropped below predetermined limits, thepayload fairingthat protectedJunoduring launch and transit through the thickest part of the atmosphere separated, about 3 minutes 24 seconds into the flight. The Atlas V main engine cut off 4 minutes 26 seconds after liftoff. Sixteen seconds later, theCentaur second stageignited, and it burned for about 6 minutes, putting the satellite into an initialparking orbit.The vehicle coasted for about 30 minutes, and then the Centaur was reignited for a second firing of 9 minutes, placing the spacecraft on anEarthescape trajectory in aheliocentric orbit. Prior to separation, the Centaur stage used onboardreaction enginesto spinJunoup to 1.4r.p.m.About 54 minutes after launch, the spacecraft separated from the Centaur and began to extend itssolar panels.Following the full deployment and locking of the solar panels,Juno'sbatteries began to recharge. Deployment of the solar panels reducedJuno'sspin rate by two-thirds. The probe is spun to ensure stability during the voyage and so that all instruments on the probe are able to observe Jupiter. The voyage to Jupiter took five years, and included two orbital maneuvers in August and September 2012 and aflyby of the Earthon October 9, 2013.When it reached theJovian system,Junohad traveled approximately 19 astronomical units (2.8 billion kilometres). After traveling for about a year in anellipticalheliocentric orbit,Junoperformed two deep space maneuvers (DSMs), firing its engine twice nearaphelion(beyond the orbit ofMars) to change its orbitand return to pass by theEarthat a distance of 559 kilometers in October 2013.The combination of the DSMs and the resulting Earth flybyhelped Juno slingshot itself toward the Jovian system in a maneuver called agravity assist.The spacecraft received a boost in speed of more than 3.9 km/s (8,700 mph), and it was set on a course to Jupiter.The flyby was also used as a rehearsal for theJunoscience team to test some instruments and practice certain procedures before the arrival at Jupiter. Jupiter's gravity accelerated the approaching spacecraft to around 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph).On July 5, 2016, between 03:18 and 03:53UTCEarth-received time, an insertion burn lasting 2,102 seconds deceleratedJunoby 542 m/s (1,780 ft/s)and changed its trajectory from ahyperbolicflyby to anelliptical, polar orbit with a period of about 53.5 days.The spacecraft successfully entered Jovian orbit on July 5, 2016, at 03:53 UTC. Juno'shighly elliptical initial polar orbit takes it within 4,200 km (2,600 mi) of the planet and out to 8.1×10^6km (5.0×10^6mi), far beyondCallisto's orbit. Aneccentricity-reducing burn, called the Period Reduction Maneuver, was planned that would drop the probe into a much shorter 14 day science orbit.Originally,Junowas expected to complete 37 orbits over 20 months before the end of its mission. Due to problems with helium valves that are important during main engine burns, mission managers announced on February 17, 2017, thatJunowould remain in its original 53-day orbit, since the chance of an engine misfire putting the spacecraft into a bad orbit was too high.Junocompleted only 12 science orbits before the end of its budgeted mission plan, ending July 2018.In June 2018, NASA extended the mission through July 2021, as described below. The orbits were carefully planned in order to minimize contact with Jupiter's denseradiation belts, which can damage spacecraft electronics and solar panels, by exploiting a gap in the radiation envelope near the planet, passing through a region of minimal radiation.TheJuno Radiation Vault, with 1-centimeter-thicktitaniumwalls (three times as thick as theGalileospacecraft body's), also aids in protectingJuno'selectronics by reducing the incoming radiation by a factor of 800.Despite the intense radiation, JunoCam and the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) were designed to endure at least eight orbits, while the Microwave Radiometer (MWR) was made to endure at least eleven orbits. All instruments are operational as of perijove 71.Although the flux of electrons close to Jupiter is about ten times as high as it is around Jupiter's moon Europa,Junowill still receive a lower total dose of radiation in its polar orbit (20Mradthrough end of mission)than theGalileoorbiterreceived in its equatorial orbit.Galileo'ssubsystems were damaged by radiation during its mission, including an LED in its data recording system. The spacecraft completed its first flyby of Jupiter (perijove1) on August 26, 2016, and captured the first images of the planet's north pole. On October 14, 2016, days prior to perijove 2 and the planned Period Reduction Maneuver, telemetry showed that some ofJuno'shelium valves were not opening properly.On October 18, 2016, some 13 hours before its second close approach to Jupiter,Junoentered intosafe mode, an operational mode engaged when its onboard computer encounters unexpected conditions. The spacecraft powered down all non-critical systems and reoriented itself to face the Sun to gather the most power. Due to this, no science operations were conducted during perijove 2. On December 11, 2016, the spacecraft completed perijove 3, with all but one instrument operating and returning data. One instrument, JIRAM, was off pending a flight software update.Perijove 4 occurred on February 2, 2017, with all instruments operating.Perijove 5 occurred on March 27, 2017.Perijove 6 took place on May 19, 2017. Although the mission's lifetime is inherently limited by radiation exposure, almost all of this dose was planned to be acquired during the perijoves. As of 2017[update], the 53.4 day orbit was planned to be maintained through July 2018 for a total of twelve science-gathering perijoves. At the end of this prime mission, the project was planned to go through a science review process by NASA'sPlanetary Science Divisionto determine if it will receive funding for an extended mission. In June 2018, NASA extended the mission operations plan to July 2021. In January 2021, NASA extended the mission operations to September 2025.In this phaseJunobegan to examine Jupiter'smajor moons,Ganymede,Europaand Io. A flyby of Ganymede occurred on June 7, 2021, 17:35UTC, coming within 1,038 km (645 mi), the closest any spacecraft has come to the moon sinceGalileoin 2000.A flyby of Europa took place on September 29, 2022, at a distance of 352 km (219 mi).Juno performed two flybys of Io on December 30, 2023, and February 3, 2024, gathering observational data on volcanic activity. From April 2024, Juno will begin a series of experiments to learn more about Jupiter's interior shape and structure. NASA originally planned todeorbitthe spacecraft into the atmosphere of Jupiter after completing 32 orbits of Jupiter, but has since extended the mission to September 2025.The controlled deorbit is intended to eliminate space debris andrisks of contaminationofpossible life-bearing moons(especially Europa) by surviving terrestrial microorganisms onboard the spacecraft in accordance with NASA'splanetary protectionguidelines. Scott Boltonof theSouthwest Research InstituteinSan Antonio,Texasis the principal investigator and is responsible for all aspects of the mission. TheJet Propulsion LaboratoryinCaliforniamanages the mission and theLockheed Martin Corporationwas responsible for the spacecraft development and construction. The mission is being carried out with the participation of several institutional partners. Coinvestigators includeToby Owenof theUniversity of Hawaii,Andrew IngersollofCalifornia Institute of Technology,Frances Bagenalof theUniversity of Colorado at Boulder, andCandy Hansenof thePlanetary Science Institute.Jack Connerneyof theGoddard Space Flight Centerserved as instrument lead. Junowas originally proposed at a cost of approximately US$700 million (fiscal year 2003) for a launch in June 2009 (equivalent to US$1197 million in 2024). NASA budgetary restrictions resulted in postponement until August 2011, and a launch on board anAtlas Vrocket in the551 configuration. As of 2019[update]the mission was projected to cost US$1.46 billion for operations and data analysis through 2022. TheJunospacecraft's suite of science instruments will: TheJunomission's scientific objectives are being achieved with a payload of nine instruments on board the spacecraft: Themicrowave radiometercomprises six antennas mounted on two of the sides of the body of the probe. They will perform measurements ofelectromagnetic waveson frequencies in themicrowaverange: 600MHz, 1.2, 2.4, 4.8, 9.6 and 22 GHz, the only microwave frequencies which are able to pass through the thick Jovian atmosphere. The radiometer will measure the abundance of water and ammonia in the deep layers of the atmosphere up to 200 bar (20 MPa; 2,900 psi) pressure or 500–600 km (310–370 mi) deep. The combination of different wavelengths and the emission angle should make it possible to obtain a temperature profile at various levels of the atmosphere. The data collected will determine how deep the atmospheric circulation is.The MWR is designed to function through orbit 11 of Jupiter.(Principal investigator: Mike Janssen,Jet Propulsion Laboratory) The spectrometer mapper JIRAM, operating in thenear infrared(between 2 and 5 μm), conducts surveys in the upper layers of the atmosphere to a depth of between 50 and 70 km (31 and 43 mi) where the pressure reaches 5 to 7 bar (500 to 700 kPa). JIRAM will provide images of the aurora in the wavelength of 3.4 μm in regions with abundantH3+ions. By measuring the heat radiated by the atmosphere of Jupiter, JIRAM can determine how clouds with water are flowing beneath the surface. It can also detectmethane,water vapor,ammoniaandphosphine. It was not required that this device meets the radiation resistance requirements.The JIRAM instrument is expected to operate through the eighth orbit of Jupiter.(Principal investigator: Alberto Adriani,Italian National Institute for Astrophysics) JIRAM's  spin-compensation mirror is stuck since PJ44, but the instrument is operational. The magnetic field investigation has three goals: mapping of the magnetic field, determining the dynamics of Jupiter's interior, and determination of the three-dimensional structure of the polar magnetosphere. The magnetometer experiment consists of the Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM), which will observe the strength and direction of the magnetic field lines, and the Advanced Stellar Compass (ASC), which will monitor the orientation of the magnetometer sensors.(Principal investigator: Jack Connerney, NASA'sGoddard Space Flight Center) The purpose of measuring gravity by radio waves is to establish a map of the distribution of mass inside Jupiter. The uneven distribution of mass in Jupiter induces small variations in gravity all along the orbit followed by the probe when it runs closer to the surface of the planet. These gravity variations drive small probe velocity changes. The purpose of radio science is to detect theDoppler effecton radio broadcasts issued byJunotoward Earth inKa-bandandX-band, which are frequency ranges that can conduct the study with fewer disruptions related to thesolar windor Jupiter'sionosphere.(Principal investigator: John Anderson,Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Principal investigator (Juno's Ka-band Translator): Luciano Iess,Sapienza University of Rome) The energetic particle detector JADE will measure the angular distribution, energy, and the velocity vector of ions and electrons atlowenergy (ions between 13eVand 20 KeV, electrons of 200 eV to 40 KeV) present in the aurora of Jupiter. On JADE, like JEDI, the electron analyzers are installed on three sides of the upper plate which allows a measure of frequency three times higher.(Principal investigator:David McComas,Southwest Research Institute) The energetic particle detector JEDI will measure the angular distribution and the velocity vector of ions and electrons athighenergy (ions between 20 keV and 1 MeV, electrons from 40 to 500 keV) present in the polarmagnetosphereof Jupiter. JEDI has three identical sensors dedicated to the study of particular ions ofhydrogen,helium,oxygenandsulfur.(Principal investigator: Barry Mauk,Applied Physics Laboratory) This instrument will identify the regions of auroral currents that define Jovian radio emissions and acceleration of the auroral particles by measuring the radio and plasma spectra in the auroral region. It will also observe the interactions betweenJupiter's atmosphereandmagnetosphere. The instrument consists of two antennae that detect radio and plasma waves.(Principal investigator: William Kurth,University of Iowa) UVS will record the wavelength, position and arrival time of detectedultravioletphotons during the time when the spectrograph slit views Jupiter during each turn of the spacecraft. The instrument will provide spectral images of the UV auroral emissions in the polar magnetosphere.(Principal investigator: G. Randall Gladstone,Southwest Research Institute) A visible light camera/telescope, included in the payload to facilitate education andpublic outreach; later re-purposed to study the dynamics of Jupiter's clouds, particularly those at the poles.It was anticipated that it would operate through only eight orbits of Jupiter ending in September 2017due to the planet's damaging radiation and magnetic field,during Juno's 47th orbit, the imager began showing hints of radiation damage. By orbit 56, nearly all the images were corrupted; the cause was identified as a damaged voltage regulator. Byannealingthe camera at a temperature of 25 °C (77 °F), the camera was brought back to operations. Junocam undergoes this operation periodically and as of July 2025 remains in operation.(Principal investigator:Michael C. Malin,Malin Space Science Systems) Juno'ssatellite bus, its main electronics and propulsion box, is ahexagonal prism. Junois the first mission to Jupiter to usesolar panelsinstead of theradioisotope thermoelectric generators(RTG) used byPioneer 10,Pioneer 11, theVoyager program,Ulysses,Cassini–Huygens,New Horizons, and theGalileoorbiter.It is also the farthest solar-powered trip in the history of space exploration.Once in orbit around Jupiter,Junoreceives only 4% as much sunlight as it would onEarth, but the global shortage ofplutonium-238at the time,as well as advances made in solar cell technology over the past several decades, makes it economically preferable to use solar panels of practical size to provide power at a distance of 5a.u.from theSun. TheJunospacecraft uses three solar panels symmetrically arranged around the spacecraft. Shortly after it cleared Earth's atmosphere, the panels were deployed. Two of the panels have four hinged segments each, and the third panel has three segments and amagnetometer. Each panel is 2.7 by 8.9 m (8 ft 10 in by 29 ft 2 in)providing 50 square metres (540 sq ft) of active cells– the largest on any NASA deep-space probe at the time of launching. The combined mass of the three panels is nearly 340 kg (750 lb).If the panels were optimized to operate at Earth, they would produce 12 to 14 kilowatts of power. Only about 486 watts were generated whenJunoarrived at Jupiter, projected to decline to near 420 watts as radiation degrades the cells.The solar panels will remain in sunlight continuously from launch through the end of the mission, except for short periods during the operation of the main engine and eclipses by Jupiter. A central power distribution and drive unit monitors the power that is generated by the solar panels and distributes it to instruments, heaters, and experiment sensors, as well as to batteries that are charged when excess power is available. Two 55Ahlithium-ionbatteries that are able to withstand the radiation environment of Jupiter provide power whenJunopasses through eclipse. Junousesin-band signaling("tones") for several critical operations as well as status reporting during cruise mode,but it is expected to be used infrequently. Communications are via the 34 m (112 ft) and 70 m (230 ft)antennasof theNASA Deep Space Network(DSN) utilizing anX-banddirect link.The command and data processing of theJunospacecraft includes a flight computer capable of providing about 50 Mbit/s of instrument throughput. Gravity science subsystems use the X-band andKa-bandDopplertracking and autoranging. Due to telecommunications constraints,Junowill only be able to return about 40 megabytes of JunoCam data during each 11-day orbital period, limiting the number of images that are captured and transmitted during each orbit to somewhere between 10 and 100 depending on the compression level used.[needs update]The overall amount of data downlinked on each orbit is significantly higher and used for the mission's scientific instruments; JunoCam is intended for public outreach and is thus secondary to the science data. This is comparable to the previousGalileomissionthat orbited Jupiter, which captured thousands of imagesdespite its slow data rate of 1000 bit/s (at maximum compression level) due to thefailure of its high gain antenna. The communication system is also used as part of theGravity Scienceexperiment. Junouses aLEROS 1bmain engine withhypergolic propellant, manufactured byMoog IncinWestcott, Buckinghamshire, England.It uses approx. 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) ofhydrazineandnitrogen tetroxidefor propulsion, including 1,232 kg (2,716 lb) available for the Jupiter Orbit Insertion plus subsequent orbital maneuvers. The engine provides a thrust of 645newtons. The engine bell is enclosed in a debris shield fixed to the spacecraft body, and is used for major burns. For control of the vehicle's orientation (attitude control) and to perform trajectory correction maneuvers,Junoutilizes amonopropellantreaction control system(RCS) consisting of twelve small thrusters that are mounted on four engine modules. Junocarries a plaque to Jupiter, dedicated toGalileo Galilei. The plaque was provided by theItalian Space Agency(ASI) and measures 7.1 by 5.1 cm (2.8 by 2.0 in). It is made of flight-gradealuminumand weighs 6 g (0.21 oz).The plaque depicts a portrait of Galileo and a text in Galileo's own handwriting, penned in January 1610, while observing what would later be known to be theGalilean moons.The text translates as: On the 11th it was in this formation – and the star closest to Jupiter was half the size than the other and very close to the other so that during the previous nights all of the three observed stars looked of the same dimension and among them equally afar; so that it is evident that around Jupiter there are three moving stars invisible till this time to everyone. The spacecraft also carries threeLego minifiguresrepresenting Galileo Galilei, the Roman godJupiter, and his sister and wife, the goddessJuno. In Roman mythology, Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief. Juno was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature. The Juno minifigure holds a magnifying glass as a sign of searching for the truth, and Jupiter holds a lightning bolt. The third Lego crew member, Galileo Galilei, has his telescope with him on the journey.The figurines were produced in partnership between NASA andLegoas part of an outreach program to inspire children's interest inscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics(STEM).Although most Lego toys are made of plastic, Lego specially made these minifigures of aluminum to endure the extreme conditions of space flight. Among early results,Junogathered information about Jovian lightning that revised earlier theories.Junoprovided the first views of Jupiter's north pole, as well as providing insight about Jupiter's aurorae, magnetic field, and atmosphere. In 2021, analysis of the frequency of interplanetary dust impacts (primarily on the backs of the solar panels), as Juno passed between Earth and the asteroid belt, indicated that this dust, which causes theZodiacal light, comes fromMars, rather than from comets or asteroids that come from the outer solar system, as was previously thought. Juno made many discoveries that are challenging existing theories about Jupiter's formation. When Juno flew over the poles of Jupiter it imaged clusters of stable cyclones that exist at the poles.It found that the magnetosphere of Jupiter is uneven and chaotic. Using its Microwave Radiometer, Juno found that the red and white bands that can be seen on Jupiter extend hundreds of kilometers into the Jovian atmosphere, yet the interior of Jupiter is not evenly mixed. This has resulted in the theory that Jupiter does not have a solid core as previously thought, but a "fuzzy" core made of pieces of rock andmetallic hydrogen. This peculiar core may be a result of a collision that happened early on in Jupiter's formation. In April 2020,Junodetected ameteor impact on Jupiter, with estimated mass of 250–5000 kg. Results fromJunoon storms suggests that they are far taller than expected, with some extending 60 miles (100 kilometers) below the cloud tops and others, including the Great Red Spot, extending over 200 miles (350 kilometers). WithJunotraveling low over Jupiter's cloud deck at about 130,000 mph (209,000 kph) Juno scientists were able to measure velocity changes as small as 0.01 millimeter per second using a NASA's Deep Space Network tracking antenna, from a distance of more than 400 million miles (650 million kilometers). This enabled the team to constrain the depth of the Great Red Spot to about 300 miles (500 kilometers) below the cloud tops. The new results show that the cyclones are warmer on top, with lower atmospheric densities, while they are colder at the bottom, with higher densities. Anticyclones, which rotate in the opposite direction, are colder at the top but warmer at the bottom.

TheVoyager programis an American scientific program that employs twointerstellar probes,Voyager 1andVoyager 2. They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment to explore the two gas giantsJupiterandSaturnand potentially also the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune—tofly near themwhile collecting data for transmission back to Earth. AfterVoyager 1successfully completed its flyby of Saturn and its moonTitan, it was decided to sendVoyager 2on flybys ofUranusandNeptune. After the planetary flybys were complete, decisions were made to keep the probes in operation to exploreinterstellar spaceand the outer regions of the Solar System. On 25 August 2012, data fromVoyager 1indicated that it had entered interstellar space.On 5 November 2019, data fromVoyager 2indicated that it also had entered interstellar space.On 4 November 2019, scientists reported that on 5 November 2018, theVoyager 2probe had officially reached theinterstellar medium(ISM), a region ofouter spacebeyond the influence of thesolar wind, as didVoyager 1in 2012.In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by theNew Horizonsspacecraft, the existence of a "hydrogen wall" at the outer edges of the Solar System that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft. As of 2024,[update]the Voyagers are still in operation beyond the outer boundary of theheliosphereininterstellar space.Voyager 1is moving with a velocity of 61,198 kilometers per hour (38,027 mph), or 17 km/s, (10.5 miles/second) relative to the Sun, and is 24,475,900,000 kilometers (1.52086×1010mi) from the Sunreaching a distance of 162AU(24.2billionkm; 15.1 billionmi) from Earth as of May 25, 2024.As of 2024[update],Voyager 2is moving with a velocity of 55,347 kilometers per hour (34,391 mph), or 15 km/s, relative to the Sun, and is 20,439,100,000 kilometers (1.27003×1010mi) from the Sunreaching a distance of 136.627AU(20.4billionkm; 12.7 billionmi) from Earth as of May 25, 2024. The two Voyagers are the only human-made objects to date that have passed into interstellar space — a record they will hold until at least the 2040s — andVoyager 1is the farthest human-made object from Earth. Voyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one expected, and promises to outlive its inventors. Like a great painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers. The two Voyager space probes were originally conceived as part of thePlanetary Grand Tourplanned during the late 1960s and early 70s that aimed to exploreJupiter,Saturn, Saturn's moonTitan,Uranus,Neptune, andPluto. The mission originated from theGrand Tour program, conceptualized byGary Flandro, anaerospace engineerat the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in 1964, which leveraged a rareplanetary alignmentoccurring once every 175 years.This alignment allowed a craft to reach allouter planetsusinggravitational assists. The mission was to send several pairs of probes and gained momentum in 1966 when it was endorsed byNASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory. However, in December 1971, the Grand Tour mission was canceled when funding was redirected to theSpace Shuttle program. In 1972, a scaled-down (four planets, two identical spacecraft) mission was proposed, utilizing a spacecraft derived from theMarinerseries, initially intended to beMariner 11andMariner 12. Thegravity-assisttechnique, successfully demonstrated byMariner 10, would be used to achieve significant velocity changes by maneuvering through an intermediate planet'sgravitational fieldto minimize time towards Saturn.The spacecrafts were then moved into a separate program namedMariner Jupiter-Saturn(alsoMariner Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus,MJS, orMJSU), part of theMariner program, later renamed because it was thought that the design of the two space probes had progressed sufficiently beyond that of the Mariner family to merit a separate name. On March 4, 1977,NASAannounced a competition to rename the mission, believing the existing name was not appropriate as the mission had differed significantly from previousMarinermissions.Voyagerwas chosen as the new name, referencing an earlier suggestion byWilliam Pickering, who had proposed the nameNavigator. Due to the name change occurring close to launch, the probes were still occasionally referred to as Mariner 11 and Mariner 12, or even Voyager 11 and Voyager 12. Two mission trajectories were established: JST aimed at Jupiter, Saturn, and enhancing aTitanflyby, while JSX served as a contingency plan. JST focused on a Titan flyby, while JSX provided a flexible mission plan. If JST succeeded, JSX could proceed with the Grand Tour, but in case of failure, JSX could be redirected for a separate Titan flyby, forfeiting the Grand Tour opportunity.The second probe, nowVoyager 2, followed the JSX trajectory, granting it the option to continue on to Uranus and Neptune. UponVoyager 1completing its main objectives at Saturn, Voyager 2 received a mission extension, enabling it to proceed to Uranus and Neptune. This allowed Voyager 2 to diverge from the originally planned JST trajectory. The probes would be launched in August or September 1977, with their main objective being to compare the characteristics of Jupiter and Saturn, such as theiratmospheres,magnetic fields, particle environments,ring systems, andmoons. They would fly by planets and moons in either a JST or JSX trajectory. After completing their flybys, the probes would communicate with Earth, relaying vital data using theirmagnetometers,spectrometers, and other instruments to detectinterstellar,solar, andcosmic radiation. Their radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) would limit the maximum communication time with the probes to roughly adecade. Following their primary missions, the probes would continue to drift into interstellar space. Voyager 2was the first to be launched. Its trajectory was designed to allow flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.Voyager 1was launched afterVoyager 2, but along a shorter and faster trajectory that was designed to provide an optimal flyby of Saturn's moonTitan,which was known to be quite large and to possess a dense atmosphere. This encounter sentVoyager 1out of the plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission.HadVoyager 1been unable to perform the Titan flyby, the trajectory ofVoyager 2could have been altered to explore Titan, forgoing any visit to Uranus and Neptune.Voyager 1was not launched on a trajectory that would have allowed it to continue to Uranus and Neptune, but could have continued from Saturn to Pluto without exploring Titan. During the 1990s,Voyager 1overtook the slower deep-space probesPioneer 10andPioneer 11to become the most distant human-made object from Earth, a record that it will keep for the foreseeable future. TheNew Horizonsprobe, which had a higher launch velocity thanVoyager 1, is travelling more slowly due to the extra speedVoyager 1gained from its flybys of Jupiter and Saturn.Voyager 1and Pioneer 10 are the most widely separated human-made objects anywhere since they are travelling in roughly opposite directions from theSolar System. In December 2004,Voyager 1crossed thetermination shock, where the solar wind is slowed to subsonic speed, and entered theheliosheath, where the solar wind is compressed and made turbulent due to interactions with theinterstellar medium. On 10 December 2007,Voyager 2also reached the termination shock, about 1.6 billion kilometres (1 billion miles) closer to the Sun than from whereVoyager 1first crossed it, indicating that the Solar System isasymmetrical. In 2010Voyager 1reported that the outward velocity of the solar wind had dropped to zero, and scientists predicted it was nearinginterstellar space.In 2011, data from the Voyagers determined that the heliosheath was not smooth, but filled with giantmagneticbubbles. It was theorized that they formed when themagnetic fieldof the Sun became warped at the edge of the Solar System. In June 2012, scientists at NASA reported thatVoyager 1was very close to entering interstellar space, which was indicated by a sharp rise inhigh-energy particlesfrom outside the Solar System.In September 2013, NASA announced thatVoyager 1had crossed theheliopauseon 25 August 2012, making it the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space. In December 2018, NASA announced thatVoyager 2had crossed the heliopause on 5 November 2018, making it the second spacecraft to enter interstellar space. As of 2017[update]Voyager 1andVoyager 2continued to monitor conditions in the outer expanses of the Solar System.The Voyager spacecraft were expected to be able to operate science instruments through 2020, when limited power would require instruments to be deactivated one by one. It was expected that circa 2025 there would no longer be sufficient power to operate any scientific instruments. In July 2019, a revised power management plan was implemented for the two probes' dwindling power supplies. The Voyager spacecraft each weighed 815 kilograms (1,797 pounds) at launch, but after fuel usage are now about 733 kilograms (1,616 pounds).Of this weight, each spacecraft carries 105 kilograms (231 pounds) of scientific instruments.The identical Voyager spacecraft use three-axis-stabilizedguidance systemsthat usegyroscopicandaccelerometerinputs to theirattitude controlcomputers to point theirhigh-gain antennastowardsthe Earthand their scientific instruments towards their targets, sometimes with the help of a movable instrument platform for the smaller instruments and theelectronic photographysystem. The diagram shows the high-gain antenna (HGA) with a 3.7 m (12 ft) diameter dish attached to the hollowdecagonalelectronicscontainer. There is also a spherical tank that contains thehydrazinemonopropellantfuel. TheVoyager Golden Recordis attached to one of the bus sides. The angled square panel to the right is the optical calibration target and excess heat radiator. The threeradioisotope thermoelectric generators(RTGs) are mounted end-to-end on the lower boom. The scan platform comprises: the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) (largest camera at top right); the Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) just above the IRIS; the two Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)vidicon camerasto the left of the UVS; and the Photopolarimeter System (PPS) under the ISS. Only five investigation teams are still supported, though data is collected for two additional instruments.The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) and a single eight-trackdigital tape recorder(DTR) provide the data handling functions. The FDS configures each instrument and controls instrument operations. It also collects engineering and science data and formats the data fortransmission. The DTR is used to record high-ratePlasmaWave Subsystem (PWS) data, which is played back every six months. The Imaging Science Subsystem made up of a wide-angle and a narrow-angle camera is a modified version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights. The Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two television-type cameras, each with eight filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons. One has a low resolution 200 mm (7.9 in)focal lengthwide-angle lens with anapertureof f/3 (the wide-angle camera), while the other uses a higher resolution 1,500 mm (59 in) narrow-angle f/8.5 lens (the narrow-angle camera). Three spacecraft were built,Voyager 1(VGR 77-1),Voyager 2(VGR 77-3), and test spare model (VGR 77-2). There are three different computer types on the Voyager spacecraft, two of each kind, sometimes used for redundancy. They are proprietary, custom-built computers built fromCMOSandTTLmedium-scale CMOS integrated circuits and discrete components, mostly from the7400 seriesofTexas Instruments.Total number ofwordsamong the six computers is about 32K. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have identical computer systems. The Computer Command System (CCS), the central controller of the spacecraft, has two 18-bit word, interrupt-type processors with 4096 words each of non-volatileplated-wire memory. During most of the Voyager mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used non-redundantly to increase the command and processing capability of the spacecraft. The CCS is nearly identical to the system flown on the Viking spacecraft. The Flight Data System (FDS) is two 16-bit word machines with modular memories and 8198 words each. The Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS) is two 18-bit word machines with 4096 words each. Unlike the other on-board instruments, the operation of the cameras forvisible lightis not autonomous, but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the on-boarddigital computers, the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). More recent space probes, since about 1990, usually have completelyautonomouscameras. The computer command subsystem (CCS) controls the cameras. The CCS contains fixedcomputer programssuch as command decoding, fault detection, and correction routines, antenna-pointing routines, and spacecraft sequencing routines. This computer is an improved version of the one that was used in theVikingorbiter.The hardware in both custom-built CCS subsystems in the Voyagers is identical. There is only a minor software modification for one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks. According to Guinness Book of Records, CCS holds record of "longest period of continual operation for a computer". It has been running continuously since 20 August 1977. The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) controls the spacecraft orientation (its attitude). It keeps the high-gain antenna pointing towards the Earth, controls attitude changes, and points the scan platform. The custom-built AACS systems on both craft are identical. It has been erroneously reportedon theInternetthat the Voyager space probes were controlled by a version of theRCA 1802(RCA CDP1802 "COSMAC"microprocessor), but such claims are not supported by the primary design documents. The CDP1802 microprocessor was used later in theGalileospace probe, which was designed and built years later. The digital control electronics of the Voyagers were not based on a microprocessor integrated-circuit chip. Theuplinkcommunications are executed viaS-bandmicrowave communications. Thedownlinkcommunications are carried out by anX-bandmicrowavetransmitter on board the spacecraft, with an S-band transmitter as a back-up. All long-range communications to and from the two Voyagers have been carried out using their 3.7-meter (12 ft) high-gain antennas. The high-gain antenna has a beamwidth of 0.5° for X-band, and 2.3° for S-band.: 17(The low-gain antenna has a 7 dB gain and 60° beamwidth.): 17 Because of theinverse-square lawinradio communications, the digital data rates used in the downlinks from the Voyagers have been continually decreasing the farther that they get from the Earth. For example, the data rate used from Jupiter was about 115,000 bits per second. That was halved at the distance of Saturn, and it has gone down continually since then.Some measures were taken on the ground along the way to reduce the effects of the inverse-square law. In between 1982 and 1985, the diameters of the three mainparabolic dish antennasof theDeep Space Networkwere increased from 64 to 70 m (210 to 230 ft): 34dramatically increasing their areas for gathering weak microwave signals. Whilst the craft were between Saturn and Uranus the onboard software was upgraded to do a degree of image compression and to use a more efficientReed-Solomon error-correcting encoding.: 33 Then between 1986 and 1989, new techniques were brought into play to combine the signals from multiple antennas on the ground into one, more powerful signal, in a kind of anantenna array.: 34This was done atGoldstone, California,Canberra (Australia), andMadrid (Spain)using the additional dish antennas available there. Also, in Australia, theParkes Radio Telescopewas brought into the array in time for the fly-by of Neptune in 1989. In the United States, theVery Large ArrayinNew Mexicowas brought into temporary use along with the antennas of the Deep Space Network at Goldstone.: 34Using this new technology of antenna arrays helped to compensate for the immense radio distance from Neptune to the Earth. Electrical poweris supplied by threeMHW-RTGradioisotope thermoelectric generators(RTGs). They are powered byplutonium-238(distinct from thePu-239isotope used in nuclear weapons) and provided approximately 470Wat 30voltsDCwhen the spacecraft was launched. Plutonium-238 decays with ahalf-lifeof 87.74 years,so RTGs using Pu-238 will lose a factor of 1−0.5(1/87.74)= 0.79% of their power output per year. In 2011, 34 years after launch, the thermal power generated by such an RTG would be reduced to (1/2)(34/87.74)≈ 76% of its initial power. The RTGthermocouples, which convert thermal power into electricity, also degrade over time reducing available electric power below this calculated level. By 7 October 2011 the power generated byVoyager 1andVoyager 2had dropped to 267.9 W and 269.2 W respectively, about 57% of the power at launch. The level of power output was better than pre-launch predictions based on a conservative thermocouple degradation model. As the electrical power decreases, spacecraft loads must be turned off, eliminating some capabilities. There may be insufficient power for communications by 2032. The Voyager primary mission was completed in 1989, with the close flyby of Neptune byVoyager 2. The Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) is a mission extension, which began when the two spacecraft had already been in flight for over 12 years.The Heliophysics Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate conducted a Heliophysics Senior Review in 2008. The panel found that the VIM "is a mission that is absolutely imperative to continue" and that VIM "funding near the optimal level and increased DSN (Deep Space Network) support is warranted." The main objective of the VIM was to extend the exploration of the Solar System beyond the outer planets to theheliopause(the farthest extent at which the Sun's radiation predominates over interstellar winds) and if possible even beyond. Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause boundary in 2012, followed by Voyager 2 in 2018. Passing through the heliopause boundary has allowed both spacecraft to make measurements of the interstellar fields, particles and waves unaffected by thesolar wind. Two significant findings so far have been the discovery of a region of magnetic bubblesand no indication of an expected shift in the Solar magnetic field. The entireVoyager 2scan platform, including all of the platform instruments, was switched off in 1998. All platform instruments onVoyager 1, except for the ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS)have also been switched off. TheVoyager 1scan platform was scheduled to go off-line in late 2000 but has been left on to investigate UV emission from the upwind direction.
UVS data are still captured but scans are no longer possible. Gyro operations ended in 2016 forVoyager 2and in 2017 forVoyager 1. Gyro operations are used to rotate the probe 360 degrees six times per year to measure the magnetic field of the spacecraft, which is then subtracted from the magnetometer science data. On 14 November 2023, Voyager 1 stopped sending all telemetry and data, though the signal was still present.  After months of experiments, made considerably more difficult by the 45 hour round trip time, the cause was traced to a bad memory chip.  New software was written to avoid the bad memory block, and engineering data resumed on 20 April 2024.Science data from two instruments resumed in May 2024,and full recovery (of all science instruments that were still powered up) was in June 2024.For more details of this intricate operation, seeVoyager 1. The two spacecraft continue to operate, with some loss in subsystem redundancy but retain the capability to return scientific data from a full complement of Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) science instruments. Both spacecraft also have adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to continue operating and collecting science data through at least 2026.Though additional science instruments may need to be turned off, the spacecraft are expected to be able to communicate until 2036, in the absence of additional failures. By the start of VIM,Voyager 1was at a distance of 40AUfrom the Earth, whileVoyager 2was at 31 AU. VIM is in three phases: termination shock, heliosheath exploration, and interstellar exploration phase. The spacecraft began VIM in an environment controlled by the Sun's magnetic field, with the plasma particles being dominated by those contained in the expanding supersonic solar wind. This is the characteristic environment of the termination shock phase. At some distance from the Sun, the supersonic solar wind will be held back from further expansion by the interstellar wind. The first feature encountered by a spacecraft as a result of this interaction – between interstellar wind and solar wind – was the termination shock, where the solar wind slows to subsonic speed, and large changes in plasma flow direction and magnetic field orientation occur.Voyager 1completed the phase of termination shock in December 2004 at a distance of 94 AU, whileVoyager 2completed it in August 2007 at a distance of 84 AU. After entering into the heliosheath, the spacecraft were in an area that is dominated by the Sun's magnetic field and solar wind particles. After passing through the heliosheath, the two Voyagers began the phase of interstellar exploration. The outer boundary of the heliosheath is called the heliopause. This is the region where the Sun's influence begins to decrease and interstellar space can be detected. Voyager 1is escaping the Solar System at the speed of 3.6 AU per year 35° north of theeclipticin the general direction of thesolar apexinHercules, whileVoyager 2's speed is about 3.3 AU per year, heading 48° south of the ecliptic. The Voyager spacecraft will eventually go on to the stars. In about40,000 years,Voyager 1will be within 1.6light years(ly) of AC+79 3888, also known asGliese 445, which is approaching the Sun. In 40,000 yearsVoyager 2will be within 1.7 ly ofRoss 248(another star which is approaching the Sun), and in296,000 yearsit will pass within 4.6 ly ofSirius, which is the brightest star in the night-sky.The spacecraft are not expected to collide with a star for 1 sextillion (1020) years. In October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in thespacebeyond theSolar System, as detected by the Voyagerspace probes. According to the researchers, this implies that "the density gradient is a large-scale feature of theVLISM(very localinterstellar medium) in the general direction of theheliospheric nose". Both spacecraft carry a 12-inch (30 cm) golden phonograph record that contains pictures and sounds of Earth, symbolic directions on the cover for playing the record, and data detailing the location of Earth.The record is intended as a combinationtime capsuleand an interstellar message to any civilization, alien or far-future human, that may recover either of the Voyagers. The contents of this record were selected by a committee that includedTimothy Ferrisand was chaired byCarl Sagan. Pale Blue Dotis a photograph ofEarthtaken on February 14, 1990, by theVoyager 1space probefrom a distance of approximately6 billionkilometers (3.7 billionmiles, 40.5AU), as part of that day'sFamily Portraitseries of images of theSolar System.The Voyager program's discoveries during the primary phase of its mission, including new close-up color photos of the major planets, were regularly documented by print and electronic media outlets. Among the best-known of these is an image of the Earth as aPale Blue Dot, taken in 1990 byVoyager 1, and popularized by Carl Sagan, Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us....The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.... To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

Galileowas an American roboticspace probethat studied the planetJupiterandits moons, as well as the asteroidsGaspraandIda. Named after the Italian astronomerGalileo Galilei, it consisted of an orbiter and an entry probe. It was delivered into Earth orbit on October 18, 1989, bySpace ShuttleAtlantis, duringSTS-34.Galileoarrived at Jupiter on December 7, 1995, aftergravitational assistflybys ofVenusandEarth, and became the first spacecraft to orbit an outer planet. TheJet Propulsion Laboratorybuilt theGalileospacecraft and managed theGalileoprogramforNASA. West Germany'sMesserschmitt-Bölkow-Blohmsupplied the propulsion module. NASA'sAmes Research Centermanaged the atmospheric probe, which was built byHughes Aircraft Company. At launch, the orbiter and probe together had a mass of 2,562 kg (5,648 lb) and stood 6.15 m (20.2 ft) tall. Spacecraft are normally stabilized either by spinning around a fixed axis or by maintaining a fixed orientation with reference to the Sun and a star.Galileodid both. One section of the spacecraft rotated at 3 revolutions per minute, keepingGalileostable and holding six instruments that gathered data from many different directions, including the fields and particles instruments. Galileowasintentionally destroyedin Jupiter's atmosphere on September 21, 2003. The next orbiter to be sent to Jupiter wasJuno, which arrived on July 5, 2016. Jupiteris the largest planet in theSolar System, with more than twice the mass of all the other planets combined.Consideration of sending a probe to Jupiter began as early as 1959.NASA's Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) for Outer Solar System Missions considered the requirements for Jupiter orbiters and atmospheric probes. It noted that the technology to build aheat shieldfor an atmospheric probe did not yet exist, and facilities to test one under the conditions found on Jupiter would not be available until 1980.NASA management designated theJet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL) as the lead center for the Jupiter Orbiter Probe (JOP) project.The JOP would be the fifth spacecraft to visit Jupiter, but the first to orbit it, and the probe would be the first to enter its atmosphere. An important decision made at this time was to use aMariner programspacecraft like that used for Voyager for the Jupiter orbiter, rather than a Pioneer. Pioneer was stabilized by spinning the spacecraft at 60rpm, which gave a 360-degree view of the surroundings, and did not require an attitude control system. By contrast, Mariner had an attitude control system with threegyroscopesand two sets of sixnitrogenjet thrusters. Attitude was determined with reference to the Sun andCanopus, which were monitored with two primary and four secondary sensors. There was also aninertial reference unitand anaccelerometer. This allowed it to take high-resolution images, but the functionality came at a cost of increased weight. A Mariner weighed 722 kilograms (1,592 lb) compared to just 146 kilograms (322 lb) for a Pioneer. John R. Casani, who had headed the Mariner and Voyager projects, became the first project manager.He solicited suggestions for a more inspirational name for the project, and the most votes went to "Galileo" afterGalileo Galilei, the first person to view Jupiter through a telescope. His 1610 discovery of what is now known as theGalilean moonsorbiting Jupiter was important evidence of theCopernican modelof the solar system. It was also noted that the name was that of aspacecraftin theStar Trektelevision show. The new name was adopted in February 1978. TheJet Propulsion Laboratorybuilt theGalileospacecraft with anoctagonal prismbusand managed theGalileomission for NASA.West Germany'sMesserschmitt-Bölkow-Blohmsupplied the propulsion module. NASA'sAmes Research Centermanaged the cone-shaped atmospheric probe, which was built byHughes Aircraft Company.At launch, the orbiter and probe together had a mass of 2,562 kg (5,648 lb) and stood 6.15 m (20.2 ft) tall.Spacecraft are normally stabilized either by spinning around a fixed axis or by maintaining a fixed orientation with reference the Sun and a star;Galileodid both. One section of the spacecraft rotated at 3revolutions per minute, keepingGalileostable and holding six instruments that gathered data from many different directions, including the fields and particles instruments.Back on the ground, the mission operations team used software containing 650,000 lines of code in the orbit sequence design process; 1,615,000 lines in the telemetry interpretation; and 550,000 lines of code in navigation.All of the spacecraft components and spare parts received a minimum of 2,000 hours of testing. The spacecraft was expected to last for at least five years—long enough to reach Jupiter and perform its mission. On December 19, 1985, it departed the JPL inPasadena, California, on the first leg of its journey, a road trip to theKennedy Space CenterinFlorida.Due to theSpace ShuttleChallengerdisaster, the May launch date could not be met.The mission was rescheduled to October 12, 1989. TheGalileospacecraft would be launched by theSTS-34mission in theSpace ShuttleAtlantis.As the launch date ofGalileoneared,anti-nuclear groups, concerned over what they perceived as an unacceptable risk to the public's safety from theplutoniumin theGalileo'sradioisotope thermoelectric generators(RTGs) and General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) modules, sought a court injunction prohibitingGalileo'slaunch.RTGs were necessary for deep space probes because they had to fly distances from the Sun that made the use of solar energy impractical. The launch was delayed twice more: by a faulty main engine controller that forced a postponement to October 17, and then by inclement weather, which necessitated a postponement to the following day,but this was not a concern since the launch window extended until November 21.Atlantisfinally lifted off at 16:53:40UTCon October 18, and went into a 343-kilometer (213 mi) orbit.Galileowas successfully deployed at 00:15 UTC on October 19.Following the IUS burn, theGalileospacecraft adopted its configuration for solo flight, and separated from the IUS at 01:06:53 UTC on October 19.The launch was perfect, andGalileowas soon headed towards Venus at over 14,000 km/h (9,000 mph).Atlantisreturned to Earth safely on October 23. The CDH subsystem was actively redundant, with two paralleldata system busesrunning at all times.Each data system bus (a.k.a. string) was composed of the same functional elements, consisting of multiplexers (MUX), high-level modules (HLM), low-level modules (LLM), power converters (PC), bulk memory (BUM), data management subsystem bulk memory (DBUM), timing chains (TC),phase locked loops(PLL),Golaycoders (GC), hardware command decoders (HCD) and critical controllers (CRC). The CDH subsystem was responsible for maintaining the following functions: The spacecraft was controlled by sixRCA 1802COSMACmicroprocessorCPUs: four on the spun side and two on the despun side. Each CPU was clocked at about 1.6 MHz, and fabricated onsapphire(silicon on sapphire), which is aradiation-and static-hardenedmaterial ideal for spacecraft operation. This 8-bit microprocessor was the first low-powerCMOSprocessor chip, similar to the6502that was being built into theApple IIdesktop computerat that time. The Galileo Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACSE) was controlled by twoItekAdvanced Technology Airborne Computers(ATAC), built using radiation-hardened2901s. The AACSE could be reprogrammed in flight by sending the new program through the Command and Data Subsystem.The attitude control system software was written in theHAL/Sprogramming language,which was also used in theSpace Shuttle program. Memory capacity provided by each BUM was 16K ofRAM, while the DBUMs each provided 8K of RAM. There were two BUMs and two DBUMs in the CDH subsystem and they all resided on the spun side of the spacecraft. The BUMs and DBUMs provided storage for sequences and contain various buffers for telemetry data and interbus communication. Every HLM and LLM was built up around a single 1802 microprocessor and 32K of RAM (for HLMs) or 16K of RAM (for LLMs). Two HLMs and two LLMs resided on the spun side while two LLMs were on the despun side. Thus, total memory capacity available to the CDH subsystem was 176K of RAM: 144K allocated to the spun side and 32K to the despun side.Each HLM was responsible for the following functions: Each LLM was responsible for the following functions: The propulsion subsystem consisted of a 400 N (90 lbf) main engine and twelve 10 N (2.2 lbf) thrusters, together with propellant, storage and pressurizing tanks and associated plumbing. The 10 N thrusters were mounted in groups of six on two 2-meter (6.6 ft) booms. The fuel for the system was 925 kg (2,039 lb) ofmonomethylhydrazineandnitrogen tetroxide. Two separate tanks held another 7 kg (15 lb) ofheliumpressurant. The propulsion subsystem was developed and built byMesserschmitt-Bölkow-Blohmand provided by West Germany, the major international partner in ProjectGalileo. At the time,solar panelswere not practical at Jupiter's distance from the Sun; the spacecraft would have needed a minimum of 65 square meters (700 sq ft) of panels. Chemical batteries would likewise be prohibitively large due to technological limitations. The solution was tworadioisotope thermoelectric generators(RTGs) which powered the spacecraft through the radioactive decay ofplutonium-238. The heat emitted by this decay was converted into electricity through the solid-stateSeebeck effect. This provided a reliable and long-lasting source of electricity unaffected by the cold environment and high-radiation fields in the Jovian system. EachGPHS-RTG, mounted on a 5-meter-long (16 ft) boom, carried 7.8 kilograms (17 lb) of238Pu. Each RTG contained 18 separate heat source modules, and each module encased four pellets ofplutonium(IV) oxide, aceramicmaterial resistant to fracturing.The plutonium was enriched to about 83.5 percent plutonium-238.The modules were designed to survive a range of potential accidents: launch vehicle explosion or fire, re-entry into the atmosphere followed by land or water impact, and post-impact situations. An outer covering ofgraphiteprovided protection against the structural, thermal, and eroding environments of a potential re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Additional graphite components provided impact protection, whileiridiumcladding of the RTGs provided post-impact containment.The RTGs produced about 570 watts at launch. The power output initially decreased at the rate of 0.6 watts per month and was 493 watts whenGalileoarrived at Jupiter. The spacecraft had a large high-gain antenna which failed to deploy during the mission, so the low-gain antenna was used instead, limiting data transfer to slowerbit rates. Scientific instruments to measure fields and particles were mounted on the spinning section of the spacecraft, together with the mainantenna, power supply, the propulsion module and most ofGalileo'scomputers and control electronics. The sixteen instruments, weighing 118 kg (260 lb) altogether, includedmagnetometersensors mounted on an 11 m (36 ft) boom to minimize interference from the spacecraft; aplasmainstrument for detecting low-energy charged particles and a plasma-wave detector to study waves generated by the particles; a high-energy particle detector; and a detector of cosmic and Joviandust. It also carried the Heavy Ion Counter, an engineering experiment to assess the potentially hazardous charged particle environments the spacecraft flew through, and anextreme ultravioletdetector associated with the UV spectrometer on the scan platform. The despun section's instruments included the camera system; thenear infraredmapping spectrometer to make multi-spectral images for atmospheric and moon surface chemical analysis; the ultraviolet spectrometer to study gases; and the photopolarimeter-radiometer to measure radiant and reflected energy. The camera system was designed to obtain images of Jupiter's satellites at resolutions 20 to 1,000 times better thanVoyager'sbest, becauseGalileoflew closer to the planet and its inner moons, and because the more modernCCDsensor inGalileo'scamera was more sensitive and had a broader color detection band than thevidiconsofVoyager. The SSI was an 800-by-800-pixelcharge-coupled device(CCD) camera. The optical portion of the camera was a modified flight spare of theVoyagernarrow-angle camera; aCassegrain telescope.The CCD had radiation shielding a 10 mm (0.4 in) thick layer oftantalumsurrounding the CCD except where the light enters the system. An eight-position filter wheel was used to obtain images at specific wavelengths. The images were then combined electronically on Earth to produce color images. The spectral response of the SSI ranged from about 400 to 1100 nm. The SSI weighed 29.7 kg (65 lb) and consumed, on average, 15 watts of power. The NIMS instrument was sensitive to 0.7-to-5.2-micrometerwavelengthinfraredlight, overlapping the wavelength range of the SSI. NIMS used a 229 mm (9 in) aperture reflecting telescope. Thespectrometerused a grating to disperse the light collected by the telescope. The dispersed spectrum of light was focused on detectors ofindium,antimonideandsilicon. NIMS weighed 18 kg (40 lb) and used 12 watts of power on average. TheCassegrain telescopeof the UVS had a 250 mm (9.8 in) aperture. Both the UVS and EUV instruments used a ruledgratingto disperse light for spectral analysis. Light then passed through an exit slit intophotomultipliertubes that produced pulses of electrons, which were counted and the results sent to Earth. The UVS was mounted onGalileo'sscan platform. The EUV was mounted on the spun section. AsGalileorotated, EUV observed a narrow ribbon of space perpendicular to the spin axis. The two instruments combined weighed about 9.7 kg (21 lb) and used 5.9 watts of power. The PPR had seven radiometry bands. One of these used no filters and observed all incoming radiation, both solar and thermal. Another band allowed only solar radiation through. The difference between the solar-plus-thermal and the solar-only channels gave the total thermal radiation emitted. The PPR also measured in five broadband channels that spanned the spectral range from 17 to 110 micrometers. The radiometer provided data on the temperatures of Jupiter's atmosphere and satellites. The design of the instrument was based on that of an instrument flown on thePioneer Venusspacecraft. A 100 mm (4 in) aperture reflecting telescope collected light and directed it to a series of filters, and, from there, measurements were performed by the detectors of the PPR. The PPR weighed 5.0 kg (11.0 lb) and consumed about 5 watts of power. Thedust-detector subsystem (DDS)was used to measure the mass, electric charge, and velocity of incoming particles. The masses of dust particles that the DDS could detect go from 10−16to 10−7grams. The speed of these small particles could be measured over the range of 1 to 70 kilometers per second (0.6 to 43.5 mi/s). The instrument could measure impact rates from 1 particle per 115 days (10 megaseconds) to 100 particles per second. Such data was used to help determine dust origin and dynamics within themagnetosphere. The DDS weighed 4.2 kg (9.3 lb) and used an average of 5.4 watts of power. The energetic-particles detector (EPD) was designed to measure the numbers and energies of ions and electrons whose energies exceeded about 20 keV (3.2 fJ). The EPD could also measure the direction of travel of such particles and, in the case of ions, could determine their composition (whether the ion isoxygenorsulfur, for example). The EPD used silicon solid-state detectors and atime-of-flightdetector system to measure changes in the energetic particle population at Jupiter as a function of position and time. These measurements helped determine how the particles got their energy and how they were transported through Jupiter's magnetosphere. The EPD weighed 10.5 kg (23 lb) and used 10.1 watts of power on average. The HIC was, in effect, a repackaged and updated version of some parts of the flight spare of theVoyagercosmic-ray system. The HIC detected heavyionsusing stacks of single crystal silicon wafers. The HIC could measure heavy ions with energies as low as 6 MeV (1 pJ) and as high as 200 MeV (32 pJ) per nucleon. This range included all atomic substances betweencarbonandnickel. The HIC and the EUV shared a communications link and, therefore, had to share observing time. The HIC weighed 8.0 kg (17.6 lb) and used an average of 2.8 watts of power. Themagnetometer(MAG) used two sets of three sensors. The three sensors allowed the three orthogonal components of themagnetic fieldsection to be measured. One set was located at the end of the magnetometer boom and, in that position, was about 11 m (36 ft) from the spin axis of the spacecraft. The second set, designed to detect stronger fields, was 6.7 m (22 ft) from the spin axis. The boom was used to remove the MAG from the immediate vicinity ofGalileoto minimize magnetic effects from the spacecraft. However, not all these effects could be eliminated by distancing the instrument. The rotation of the spacecraft was used to separate natural magnetic fields from engineering-induced fields. Another source of potential error in measurement came from the bending and twisting of the long magnetometer boom. To account for these motions, a calibration coil was mounted rigidly on the spacecraft to generate a reference magnetic field during calibrations. The magnetic field at the surface of the Earth has a strength of about 50,000nT. At Jupiter, the outboard (11 m) set of sensors could measure magnetic field strengths in the range from ±32 to ±512 nT, while the inboard (6.7 m) set was active in the range from ±512 to ±16,384 nT. The MAG experiment weighed 7.0 kg (15.4 lb) and used 3.9 watts of power. The PLS used seven fields of view to collectcharged particlesfor energy and mass analysis. These fields of view covered most angles from 0 to 180 degrees, fanning out from the spin axis. The rotation of the spacecraft carried each field of view through a full circle. The PLS measured particles in the energy range from 0.9 to 52,000eV(0.14 to 8,300aJ). The PLS weighed 13.2 kg (29 lb) and used an average of 10.7 watts of power. An electricdipole antennawas used to study the electric fields ofplasmas, while two search coil magnetic antennas studied the magnetic fields. The electric dipole antenna was mounted at the tip of the magnetometer boom. The search coil magnetic antennas were mounted on the high-gain antenna feed. Nearly simultaneous measurements of the electric and magnetic field spectrum allowedelectrostatic wavesto be distinguished fromelectromagnetic waves. The PWS weighed 7.1 kg (16 lb) and used an average of 9.8 watts. The atmospheric probe was built byHughes Aircraft Company's Space and Communications Group at itsEl Segundo, Californiaplant.It weighed 339 kilograms (747 lb) and was 86 centimeters (34 in) high. Inside the probe'sheat shield, the scientific instruments were protected from extreme heat and pressure during its high-speed journey into the Jovian atmosphere, entering at 48 kilometers per second (110,000 mph).Temperatures reached around 16,000 °C (29,000 °F).The ablative heat shield was made ofcarbon phenolic.NASA built a special laboratory, the Giant Planet Facility, to simulate the heat load, which was similar to the convective and radiative heating experienced by anICBMwarhead reentering the atmosphere. The probe's electronics were powered by 13lithium sulfur dioxide batteriesmanufactured byHoneywell's Power
Sources Center inHorsham, Pennsylvania. Each cell was the size of aD batteryso existing manufacturing tools could be used.They provided a nominal power output of about 7.2-ampere hours capacity at a minimal voltage of 28.05 volts. The probe included seven instruments for taking data on its plunge into Jupiter: In addition, the probe's heat shield contained instrumentation to measureablationduring descent. Lacking the fuel to escape Jupiter's gravity well, at the end ofGalileo'slife, the main spacecraft wasdeliberately crashedinto Jupiter on September 21, 2003, to preventforward contaminationof possible life of Jupiter's moon Europa. The Galileo Probe hadCOSPARID 1989-084E while the orbiter had id 1989-084B.Names for the spacecraft includeGalileo ProbeorJupiter Entry Probeabbreviated JEP.The related COSPAR IDs of the Galileo mission were:

TheKepler space telescopeis an inactivespace telescopelaunched byNASAin 2009to discover Earth-sizedplanets orbiting other stars.Named after astronomerJohannes Kepler,the spacecraft was launched into an Earth-trailingheliocentric orbit. The principal investigator wasWilliam J. Borucki. After nine and a half years of operation, the telescope'sreaction control systemfuel was depleted, andNASAannounced its retirement on October 30, 2018. Designed to survey a portion of Earth's region of theMilky Wayto discoverEarth-sizeexoplanetsin or nearhabitable zonesand to estimate how many of the billions of stars in the Milky Way have such planets,Kepler's sole scientific instrument is aphotometerthat continually monitored the brightness of approximately 150,000main sequence starsin a fixed field of view.These data were transmitted to Earth, thenanalyzed to detectperiodic dimming caused by exoplanets thatcross in frontof their host star. Only planets whose orbits are seen edge-on from Earth could be detected. Kepler observed 530,506 stars, and had detected 2,778 confirmed planets as of June 16, 2023. The Kepler space telescope was part of NASA'sDiscovery Programof relatively low-cost science missions. The telescope's construction and initial operation were managed by NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory, withBall Aerospaceresponsible for developing the Kepler flight system. In January 2006, the project's launch was delayed eight months because of budget cuts and consolidation at NASA.It was delayed again by four months in March 2006 due to fiscal problems.During this time, thehigh-gain antennawas changed from a design using agimbalto one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost and complexity, at the cost of one observation day per month. TheAmes Research Centerwas responsible for the ground system development, mission operations since December 2009, and scientific data analysis. The initial planned lifetime was three and a half years,but greater-than-expectednoise in the data, from both the stars and the spacecraft, meant additional time was needed to fulfill all mission goals. Initially, in 2012, the mission was expected to be extended until 2016,but on July 14, 2012, one of the fourreaction wheelsused for pointing the spacecraft stopped turning, and completing the mission would only be possible if the other three all remained reliable.Then, on May 11, 2013, a second one failed, disabling the collection of science dataand threatening the continuation of the mission. On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that they had given up trying to fix the two failed reaction wheels. This meant the current mission needed to be modified, but it did not necessarily mean the end of planet hunting.NASAhad asked the space science community to propose alternative mission plans "potentially including an exoplanet search, using the remaining two good reaction wheels and thrusters".On November 18, 2013, theK2"Second Light" proposal was reported. This would include utilizing the disabled Kepler in a way that could detecthabitable planetsaround smaller, dimmerred dwarfs.On May 16, 2014, NASA announced the approval of the K2 extension. By January 2015, Kepler and its follow-up observations had found1,013 confirmed exoplanets in about 440 star systems, along with a further 3,199 unconfirmed planet candidates.[B]Four planets have been confirmed through Kepler's K2 mission.In November 2013, astronomers estimated, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billionrockyEarth-sizeexoplanetsorbiting in thehabitable zonesofSun-likestars andred dwarfswithin theMilky Way.It is estimated that 11 billion of these planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars.The nearest such planet may be 3.7parsecs(12ly) away, according to the scientists. On January 6, 2015, NASA announced the 1,000th confirmed exoplanet discovered by the Kepler space telescope. Four of the newly confirmed exoplanets were found to orbit withinhabitable zonesof their relatedstars: three of the four,Kepler-438b,Kepler-442bandKepler-452b, are almost Earth-size and likely rocky; the fourth,Kepler-440b, is asuper-Earth.On May 10, 2016, NASA verified 1,284 new exoplanets found by Kepler, the single largest finding of planets to date. Kepler data have also helped scientists observe and understandsupernovae; measurements were collected every half-hour so the light curves were especially useful for studying these types of astronomical events. On October 30, 2018, after the spacecraft ran out of fuel, NASA announced that the telescope would be retired.The telescope was shut down the same day, bringing an end to its nine-year service. Kepler observed 530,506 stars and discovered 2,662 exoplanets over its lifetime.A newer NASA mission,TESS, launched in 2018, is continuing the search for exoplanets. The telescope has a mass of 1,039 kilograms (2,291 lb) and contains aSchmidt camerawith a 0.95-meter (37.4 in) front corrector plate (lens) feeding a 1.4-meter (55 in)primary mirror—at the time of its launch this was the largest mirror on any telescope outside Earth orbit,though theHerschel Space Observatorytook this title a few months later. Its telescope has a 115 deg2(about 12-degree diameter)field of view(FoV), roughly equivalent to the size of one's fist held at arm's length. Of this, 105 deg2is of science quality, with less than 11%vignetting. The photometer has asoft focusto provide excellentphotometry, rather than sharp images. The mission goal was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 ppm for am(V)=12 Sun-like star for a 6.5-hour integration, though the observations fell short of this objective (seemission status). The focal plane of the spacecraft's camera is made out of forty-two 50 × 25 mm (2 × 1 in)CCDsat 2200×1024pixelseach, possessing a total resolution of 94.6megapixels,which at the time made it the largest camera system launched into space.The array was cooled by heat pipes connected to an external radiator.The CCDs were read out every 6.5 seconds (to limit saturation) and co-added on board for 58.89 seconds for short cadence targets, and 1765.5 seconds (29.4 minutes) for long cadence targets.Due to the larger bandwidth requirements for the former, these were limited in number to 512 compared to 170,000 for long cadence. However, even though at launch Kepler had the highest data rate of any NASA mission,[citation needed]the 29-minute sums of all 95 million pixels constituted more data than could be stored and sent back to Earth. Therefore, the science team pre-selected the relevant pixels associated with each star of interest, amounting to about 6 percent of the pixels (5.4 megapixels). The data from these pixels was then requantized, compressed and stored, along with other auxiliary data, in the on-board 16 gigabyte solid-state recorder. Data that was stored and downlinked includes science stars,p-mode stars, smear, black level, background and full field-of-view images. The Kepler primary mirror is 1.4 meters (4.6 ft) in diameter. Manufactured by glass makerCorningusingultra-low expansion (ULE) glass, the mirror is specifically designed to have a mass only 14% that of a solid mirror of the same size.To produce a space telescope system with sufficient sensitivity to detect relatively small planets, as they pass in front of stars, a very high reflectance coating on the primary mirror was required. Usingion assisted evaporation, Surface Optics Corp. applied a protective nine-layer silver coating to enhance reflection and a dielectric interference coating to minimize the formation of color centers and atmospheric moisture absorption. In terms of photometric performance, Kepler worked well, much better than any Earth-bound telescope, but short of design goals. The objective was a combined differential photometric precision (CDPP) of 20 parts per million (PPM) on a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-hour integration. This estimate was developed allowing 10 ppm for stellar variability, roughly the value for the Sun. The obtained accuracy for this observation has a wide range, depending on the star and position on the focal plane, with a median of 29 ppm. Most of the additional noise appears to be due to a larger-than-expected variability in the stars themselves (19.5 ppm as opposed to the assumed 10.0 ppm), with the rest due to instrumental noise sources slightly larger than predicted. Because decrease in brightness from an Earth-size planet transiting a Sun-like star is so small, only 80 ppm, the increased noise means each individual transit is only a 2.7 σ event, instead of the intended 4 σ. This, in turn, means more transits must be observed to be sure of a detection. Scientific estimates indicated that a mission lasting 7 to 8 years, as opposed to the originally planned 3.5 years, would be needed to find all transiting Earth-sized planets.On April 4, 2012, the Kepler mission was approved for extension through the fiscal year 2016,but this also depended on all remaining reaction wheels staying healthy, which turned out not to be the case (seeReaction wheel issuesbelow). Keplerorbits the Sun,which avoids Earthoccultations, stray light, andgravitationalperturbations andtorquesinherent in an Earth orbit. NASA has characterized Kepler's orbit as "Earth-trailing".With an orbital period of 372.5 days, Kepler is slowly falling farther behind Earth (about 16 million milesper annum). As of May 1, 2018[update], the distance to Kepler from Earth was about 0.917 AU (137 million km).This means that after about 26 years Kepler will reach the other side of the Sun and will get back to the neighborhood of the Earth after 51 years. Until 2013 thephotometerpointed to a field in thenorthernconstellationsofCygnus,LyraandDraco, which is well out of theeclipticplane, so that sunlight never enters the photometer as the spacecraft orbits.This is also the direction of the Solar System's motion around the center of the galaxy. Thus, the stars which Kepler observed are roughly the same distance from theGalactic Centeras theSolar System, and also close to thegalactic plane. This fact is important if position in the galaxy is related to habitability, as suggested by theRare Earth hypothesis. Orientation is three-axis stabilized by sensing rotations usingfine-guidance sensorslocated on the instrument focal plane (instead of rate sensing gyroscopes, e.g. as used onHubble).and usingreaction wheelsandhydrazinethrustersto control the orientation. Kepler was operated out ofBoulder, Colorado, by theLaboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics(LASP) under contract toBall Aerospace & Technologies. The spacecraft's solar array was rotated to face the Sun at thesolsticesandequinoxes, so as to optimize the amount of sunlight falling on the solar array and to keep the heat radiator pointing towards deep space.Together, LASP and Ball Aerospace controlled the spacecraft from a mission operations center located on the research campus of theUniversity of Colorado. LASP performs essential mission planning and the initial collection and distribution of the science data. The mission's initial life-cycle cost was estimated at US$600 million, including funding for 3.5 years of operation.In 2012, NASA announced that the Kepler mission would be funded until 2016 at a cost of about $20 million per year. NASA contacted the spacecraft using theX bandcommunication link twice a week for command and status updates. Scientific data are downloaded once a month using theKabandlink at a maximum data transfer rate of approximately 550kB/s. The high gain antenna is not steerable so data collection is interrupted for a day to reorient the whole spacecraft and the high gain antenna for communications to  Earth.: 16Kepler was the first mission to rely on Ka-band data downlink, and in turn collected statistics on Ka-band performance for later missions using this technology. The Kepler space telescope conducted its own partial analysis on board and only transmitted scientific data deemed necessary to the mission in order to conserve bandwidth. Science data telemetry collected during mission operations at LASP is sent for processing to the Kepler Data Management Center (DMC) which is located at theSpace Telescope Science Instituteon the campus ofJohns Hopkins UniversityinBaltimore, Maryland. The science data telemetry is decoded and processed into uncalibratedFITS-format science data products by the DMC, which are then passed along to the Science Operations Center (SOC) at NASA Ames Research Center, for calibration and final processing. The SOC at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) develops and operates the tools needed to process scientific data for use by theKeplerScience Office (SO). Accordingly, the SOC develops the pipeline data processing software based on scientific algorithms developed jointly by the SO and SOC. During operations, the SOC: The SOC also evaluates the photometric performance on an ongoing basis and provides the performance metrics to the SO and Mission Management Office. Finally, the SOC develops and maintains the project's scientific databases, including catalogs and processed data. The SOC finally returns calibrated data products and scientific results back to the DMC for long-term archiving, and distribution to astronomers around the world through the Multimission Archive at STScI (MAST). On July 14, 2012, one of the fourreaction wheelsused for fine pointing of the spacecraft failed.While Kepler requires only three reaction wheels to accurately aim the telescope, another failure would leave the spacecraft unable to aim at its original field. After showing some problems in January 2013, a second reaction wheel failed on May 11, 2013, ending Kepler's primary mission. The spacecraft was put into safe mode, then from June to August 2013 a series of engineering tests were done to try to recover either failed wheel. By August 15, 2013, it was decided that the wheels were unrecoverable,and an engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft's remaining capabilities. This effort ultimately led to the "K2" follow-on mission observing different fields near the ecliptic. The reaction wheel failures were traced back to pitting caused by arcing between the steel ball bearings in the reaction wheel.  The arcing was in turn caused bycoronal mass ejections(CMEs) from the sun.  Kepler's position far from Earth helped in determining the cause,  due to the significant delay between the arrival of a CME at Kepler and Earth. In January 2006, the project's launch was delayed eight months because of budget cuts and consolidation at NASA.It was delayed again by four months in March 2006 due to fiscal problems.At this time, thehigh-gain antennawas changed from a gimballed design to one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost and complexity, at the cost of one observation day per month. The Kepler observatory was launched on March 7, 2009, at 03:49:57 UTC aboard aDelta IIrocket fromCape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.The launch was a success and all three stages were completed by 04:55 UTC. The cover of the telescope was jettisoned on April 7, 2009, and thefirst lightimages were taken on the next day. On April 20, 2009, it was announced that the Kepler science team had concluded that further refinement of the focus would dramatically increase the scientific return.On April 23, 2009, it was announced that the focus had been successfully optimized by moving the primary mirror 40micrometers(1.6 thousandths of an inch) towards the focal plane and tilting the primary mirror 0.0072 degree. On May 13, 2009, at 00:01 UTC, Kepler successfully completed its commissioning phase and began its search for planets around other stars. On June 19, 2009, the spacecraft successfully sent its first science data to Earth. It was discovered that Kepler had enteredsafe modeon June 15. A second safe mode event occurred on July 2. In both cases the event was triggered by aprocessor reset. The spacecraft resumed normal operation on July 3 and the science data that had been collected since June 19 was downlinked that day.On October 14, 2009, the cause of these safing events was determined to be alow voltagepower supply that provides power to theRAD750processor.On January 12, 2010, one portion of the focal plane transmitted anomalous data, suggesting a problem with focal plane MOD-3 module, covering two out of Kepler's 42CCDs. As of October 2010[update], the module was described as "failed", but the coverage still exceeded the science goals. Kepler downlinked roughly twelvegigabytesof dataabout once per month. Kepler has a fixedfield of view(FOV) against the sky. The diagram to the right shows thecelestial coordinatesand where the detector fields are located, along with the locations of a few bright stars withcelestial northat the top left corner. The mission website has a calculatorthat will determine if a given object falls in the FOV, and if so, where it will appear in the photo detector output data stream. Data on exoplanet candidates is submitted to theKepler Follow-up Program, or KFOP, to conduct follow-up observations. Kepler's field of view covers 115square degrees, around 0.25 percent of the sky, or "about two scoops of the Big Dipper". Thus, it would require around 400 Kepler-like telescopes to cover the whole sky.The Kepler field contains portions of the constellationsCygnus,Lyra, andDraco. The nearest star system in Kepler's field of view is the triple star systemGliese 1245, 15 light years from the Sun. The brown dwarf WISE J2000+3629, 22.8 ± 1 light years from the Sun is also in the field of view, but is invisible to Kepler due to emitting light primarily in infrared wavelengths. The scientific objective of the Kepler space telescope was to explore the structure and diversity ofplanetary systems.This spacecraft observes a large sample of stars to achieve several key goals: Most of theexoplanetspreviously detected by other projects weregiant planets, mostly the size ofJupiterand bigger. Kepler was designed to look for planets 30 to 600 times less massive, closer to the order of Earth's mass (Jupiter is 318 times more massive than Earth). The method used, thetransit method, involves observing repeatedtransitof planets in front of their stars, which causes a slight reduction in the star'sapparent magnitude, on the order of 0.01% for an Earth-size planet. The degree of this reduction in brightness can be used to deduce the diameter of the planet, and the interval between transits can be used to deduce the planet's orbital period, from which estimates of its orbitalsemi-major axis(usingKepler's laws) and its temperature (using models of stellar radiation) can be calculated.[citation needed] The probability of arandomplanetary orbitbeing along the line-of-sight to a star is the diameter of the star divided by the diameter of the orbit.For an Earth-size planet at 1AUtransiting a Sun-like star the probability is 0.47%, or about 1 in 210.For a planet like Venus orbiting a Sun-like star the probability is slightly higher, at 0.65%;If the host star has multiple planets, the probability of additional detections is higher than the probability of initial detection assuming planets in a given system tend to orbit in similar planes—an assumption consistent with current models of planetary system formation.For instance, if aKepler-like mission conducted by aliens observed Earth transiting the Sun, there is a 7% chance that it would also seeVenustransiting. Kepler's 115 deg2field of view gives it a much higher probability of detecting Earth-sized planets than theHubble Space Telescope, which has a field of view of only10 sq. arc-minutes. Moreover, Kepler is dedicated to detecting planetary transits, while the Hubble Space Telescope is used to address a wide range of scientific questions, and rarely looks continuously at just one starfield. Of the approximately half-million stars in Kepler's field of view, around 150,000 stars were selected for observation. More than 90,000 are G-type stars on, or near, themain sequence. Thus, Kepler was designed to be sensitive to wavelengths of 400–865 nm where brightness of those stars peaks. Most of the stars observed by Kepler have apparent visual magnitude between 14 and 16 but the brightest observed stars have apparent visual magnitude of 8 or lower. Most of the planet candidates were initially not expected to be confirmed due to being too faint for follow-up observations.All the selected stars are observed simultaneously, with the spacecraft measuring variations in their brightness every thirty minutes. This provides a better chance for seeing a transit. The mission was designed to maximize the probability of detecting planets orbiting other stars. Because Kepler must observe at least three transits to confirm that the dimming of a star was caused by a transiting planet, and because larger planets give a signal that is easier to check, scientists expected the first reported results to be larger Jupiter-size planets in tight orbits. The first of these were reported after only a few months of operation. Smaller planets, and planets farther from their sun would take longer, and discovering planets comparable to Earth were expected to take three years or longer. Data collected by Kepler is also being used for studyingvariable starsof various types and performingasteroseismology,particularly on stars showingsolar-like oscillations. Once Kepler has collected and sent back the data, raw light curves are constructed. Brightness values are then adjusted to take the brightness variations due to the rotation of the spacecraft into account. The next step is processing (folding) light curves into a more easily observable form and letting software select signals that seem potentially transit-like. At this point, any signal that shows potential transit-like features is called a threshold crossing event. These signals are individually inspected in two inspection rounds, with the first round taking only a few seconds per target. This inspection eliminates erroneously selected non-signals, signals caused by instrumental noise and obvious eclipsing binaries. Threshold crossing events that pass these tests are calledKepler Objects of Interest(KOI), receive a KOI designation and are archived. KOIs are inspected more thoroughly in a process called dispositioning. Those which pass the dispositioning are called Kepler planet candidates. The KOI archive is not static, meaning that a Kepler candidate could end up in the false-positive list upon further inspection. In turn, KOIs that were mistakenly classified as false positives could end up back in the candidates list. Not all the planet candidates go through this process.Circumbinary planetsdo not show strictly periodic transits, and have to be inspected through other methods. In addition, third-party researchers use different data-processing methods, or even search planet candidates from the unprocessed light curve data. As a consequence, those planets may be missing KOI designation. Once suitable candidates have been found from Kepler data, it is necessary to rule out false positives with follow-up tests. Usually, Kepler candidates are imaged individually with more-advanced ground-based telescopes in order to resolve any background objects which could contaminate the brightness signature of the transit signal.Another method to rule out planet candidates isastrometryfor which Kepler can collect good data even though doing so was not a design goal. While Kepler cannot detect planetary-mass objects with this method, it can be used to determine if the transit was caused by a stellar-mass object. There are a few different exoplanet detection methods which help to rule out false positives by giving further proof that a candidate is a real planet. One of the methods, calleddoppler spectroscopy, requires follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes. This method works well if the planet is massive or is located around a relatively bright star. While current spectrographs are insufficient for confirming planetary candidates with small masses around relatively dim stars, this method can be used to discover additional massive non-transiting planet candidates around targeted stars.[citation needed] In multiplanetary systems, planets can often be confirmed throughtransit timing variationby looking at the time between successive transits, which may vary if planets are gravitationally perturbed by each other. This helps to confirm relatively low-mass planets even when the star is relatively distant. Transit timing variations indicate that two or more planets belong to the same planetary system. There are even cases where a non-transiting planet is also discovered in this way. Circumbinary planetsshow much larger transit timing variations between transits than planets gravitationally disturbed by other planets. Their transit duration times also vary significantly. Transit timing and duration variations for circumbinary planets are caused by the orbital motion of the host stars, rather than by other planets.In addition, if the planet is massive enough, it can cause slight variations of the host stars' orbital periods. Despite being harder to find circumbinary planets due to their non-periodic transits, it is much easier to confirm them, as timing patterns of transits cannot be mimicked by an eclipsing binary or a background star system. In addition to transits, planets orbiting around their stars undergo reflected-light variations—like theMoon, they go throughphasesfrom full to new and back again. Because Kepler cannot resolve the planet from the star, it sees only the combined light, and the brightness of the host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic manner. Although the effect is small—the photometric precision required to see a close-in giant planet is about the same as to detect an Earth-sized planet in transit across a solar-type star—Jupiter-sized planets with an orbital period of a few days or less are detectable by sensitive space telescopes such as Kepler. In the long run, this method may help find more planets than the transit method, because the reflected light variation with orbital phase is largely independent of the planet's orbital inclination, and does not require the planet to pass in front of the disk of the star. In addition, the phase function of a giant planet is also a function of its thermal properties and atmosphere, if any. Therefore, the phase curve may constrain other planetary properties, such as the particle size distribution of the atmospheric particles. Kepler's photometric precision is often high enough to observe a star's brightness changes caused bydoppler beamingor a star's shape deformation by a companion. These can sometimes be used to rule out hot Jupiter candidates as false positives caused by a star or a brown dwarf when these effects are too noticeable.However, there are some cases where such effects are detected even by planetary-mass companions such asTrES-2b. If a planet cannot be detected through at least one of the other detection methods, it can be confirmed by determining if the possibility of a Kepler candidate being a real planet is significantly larger than any false-positive scenarios combined. One of the first methods was to see if other telescopes can see the transit as well. The first planet confirmed through this method wasKepler-22bwhich was also observed with theSpitzer Space Telescopein addition to analyzing any other false-positive possibilities.Such confirmation is costly, as small planets can generally be detected only with space telescopes. In 2014, a new confirmation method called "validation by multiplicity" was announced. From the planets previously confirmed through various methods, it was found that planets in most planetary systems orbit in a relatively flat plane, similar to the planets found in the Solar System. This means that if a star has multiple planet candidates, it is very likely a real planetary system.Transit signals still need to meet several criteria which rule out false-positive scenarios. For instance, it has to have considerable signal-to-noise ratio, it has at least three observed transits, orbital stability of those systems have to be stable and transit curve has to have a shape that partly eclipsing binaries could not mimic the transit signal. In addition, its orbital period needs to be 1.6 days or longer to rule out common false positives caused by eclipsing binaries.Validation by multiplicity method is very efficient and allows to confirm hundreds of Kepler candidates in a relatively short amount of time. A new validation method using a tool called PASTIS has been developed. It makes it possible to confirm a planet even when only a single candidate transit event for the host star has been detected. A drawback of this tool is that it requires a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio fromKeplerdata, so it can mainly confirm only larger planets or planets around quiet and relatively bright stars. Currently, the analysis of Kepler candidates through this method is underway.PASTIS was first successful for validating the planet Kepler-420b. In April 2012, an independent panel of senior NASA scientists recommended that the Kepler mission be continued through 2016. According to the senior review, Kepler observations needed to continue until at least 2015 to achieve all the stated scientific goals.On November 14, 2012, NASA announced the completion of Kepler's primary mission, and the beginning of its extended mission, which ended in 2018 when it ran out of fuel. In July 2012, one of Kepler's fourreaction wheels(wheel 2) failed.On May 11, 2013, a second wheel (wheel 4) failed, jeopardizing the continuation of the mission, as three wheels are necessary for its planet hunting.Kepler had not collected science data since May because it was not able to point with sufficient accuracy.On July 18 and 22 reaction wheels 4 and 2 were tested respectively; wheel 4 only rotated counter-clockwise but wheel 2 ran in both directions, albeit with significantly elevated friction levels.A further test of wheel 4 on July 25 managed to achieve bi-directional rotation.Both wheels, however, exhibited too much friction to be useful.On August 2, NASA put out a call for proposals to use the remaining capabilities of Kepler for other scientific missions. Starting on August 8, a full systems evaluation was conducted. It was determined that wheel 2 could not provide sufficient precision for scientific missions and the spacecraft was returned to a "rest" state to conserve fuel.Wheel 4 was previously ruled out because it exhibited higher friction levels than wheel 2 in previous tests.Sending astronauts to fix Kepler is not an option because it orbits the Sun and is millions of kilometers from Earth. On August 15, 2013, NASA announced that Kepler would not continue searching for planets using the transit method after attempts to resolve issues with two of the four reaction wheels failed.An engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecraft's capabilities, its two good reaction wheels and its thrusters.Concurrently, a scientific study was conducted to determine whether enough knowledge can be obtained from Kepler's limited scope to justify its $18 million per year cost. Possible ideas included searching for asteroids and comets, looking for evidence of supernovas, and finding huge exoplanets throughgravitational microlensing.Another proposal was to modify the software on Kepler to compensate for the disabled reaction wheels. Instead of the stars being fixed and stable in Kepler's field of view, they will drift. Proposed software was to track this drift and more or less completely recover the mission goals despite being unable to hold the stars in a fixed view. Previously collected data continued to be analyzed. In November 2013, a new mission plan named K2 "Second Light" was presented for consideration.K2 would involve using Kepler's remaining capability,photometric precisionof about 300 parts per million, compared with about 20 parts per million earlier, to collect data for the study of "supernova explosions,star formationandSolar-System bodiessuch asasteroidsandcomets, ... " and for finding and studying moreexoplanets.In this proposed mission plan, Kepler would search a much larger area in the plane ofEarth's orbitaround theSun.Celestial objects, including exoplanets, stars and others, detected by the K2 mission would be associated with theEPICacronym, standing forEcliptic Plane Input Catalog. In early 2014, the spacecraft underwent successful testing for the K2 mission.From March to May 2014, data from a new field called Field 0 was collected as a testing run.On May 16, 2014, NASA announced the approval of extending the Kepler mission to the K2 mission.Kepler's photometric precision for the K2 mission was estimated to be 50 ppm on a magnitude 12 star for a 6.5-hour integration.In February 2014, photometric precision for the K2 mission using two-wheel, fine-point precision operations was measured as 44 ppm on magnitude 12 stars for a 6.5-hour integration. The analysis of these measurements by NASA suggests the K2 photometric precision approaches that of the Kepler archive of three-wheel, fine-point precision data. On May 29, 2014, campaign fields 0 to 13 were reported and described in detail. Field 1 of the K2 mission is set towards theLeo-Virgoregion of the sky, while Field 2 is towards the "head" area ofScorpiusand includes two globular clusters,Messier 4andMessier 80,and part of theScorpius–Centaurus association, which is only about 11 million years oldand 120–140parsecs(380–470ly) distantwith probably over 1,000 members. On December 18, 2014, NASA announced that the K2 mission had detected its first confirmed exoplanet, asuper-EarthnamedHIP 116454 b. Its signature was found in a set of engineering data meant to prepare the spacecraft for the fullK2mission. Radial velocity follow-up observations were needed as only a single transit of the planet was detected. During a scheduled contact on April 7, 2016, Kepler was found to be operating in emergency mode, the lowest operational and most fuel intensive mode. Mission operations declared a spacecraft emergency, which afforded them priority access to NASA'sDeep Space Network.By the evening of April 8 the spacecraft had been upgraded to safe mode, and on April 10 it was placed into point-rest state,a stable mode which provides normal communication and the lowest fuel burn.At that time, the cause of the emergency was unknown, but it was not believed that Kepler's reaction wheels or a planned maneuver to supportK2'sCampaign 9 were responsible. Operators downloaded and analyzed engineering data from the spacecraft, with the prioritization of returning to normal science operations.Kepler was returned to science mode on April 22.The emergency caused the first half of Campaign 9 to be shortened by two weeks. In June 2016, NASA announced a K2 mission extension of three additional years, beyond the expected exhaustion of on-board fuel in 2018.In August 2018, NASA roused the spacecraft from sleep mode, applied a modified configuration to deal with thruster problems that degraded pointing performance, and began collecting scientific data for the 19th observation campaign, finding that the onboard fuel was not yet utterly exhausted. On October 30, 2018, NASA announced that the spacecraft was out of fuel and its mission was officially ended. The Kepler space telescope was in active operation from 2009 through 2013, with the first main results announced on January 4, 2010. As expected, the initial discoveries were all short-period planets. As the mission continued, additional longer-period candidates were found. As of November 2018[update], Kepler has discovered 5,011 exoplanet candidates and 2,662 confirmed exoplanets.As of August 2022, 2,056 exoplanet candidates remain to be confirmed and 2,711 are now confirmed exoplanets. NASA held a press conference to discuss early science results of the Kepler mission on August 6, 2009.At this press conference, it was revealed that Kepler had confirmed the existence of the previously known transiting exoplanetHAT-P-7b, and was functioning well enough to discover Earth-size planets. Because Kepler's detection of planets depends on seeing very small changes in brightness, stars that vary in brightness by themselves (variable stars) are not useful in this search.From the first few months of data, Kepler scientists determined that about 7,500 stars from the initial target list are such variable stars. These were dropped from the target list, and replaced by new candidates. On November 4, 2009, the Kepler project publicly released the light curves of the dropped stars.The first new planet candidate observed by Kepler was originally marked as a false positive because of uncertainties in the mass of its parent star. However, it was confirmed ten years later and is now designatedKepler-1658b. The first six weeks of data revealed five previously unknown planets, all very close to their stars.Among the notable results are one of the least dense planets yet found,two low-masswhite dwarfsthat were initially reported as being members of a new class of stellar objects,andKepler-16b, a well-characterized planet orbiting a binary star. On June 15, 2010, the Kepler mission released data on all but 400 of the ~156,000 planetary target stars to the public. 706 targets from this first data set have viable exoplanet candidates, with sizes ranging from as small as Earth to larger than Jupiter. The identity and characteristics of 306 of the 706 targets were given. The released targets included five[citation needed]candidate multi-planet systems, including six extra exoplanet candidates.Only 33.5 days of data were available for most of the candidates.NASA also announced data for another 400 candidates were being withheld to allow members of theKeplerteam to perform follow-up observations.The data for these candidates was published February 2, 2011.(See theKeplerresults for2011below.) The Kepler results, based on the candidates in the list released in 2010, implied that most candidate planets have radii less than half that of Jupiter. The  results also imply that small candidate planets with periods less than thirty days are much more common than large candidate planets with periods less than thirty days and that the ground-based discoveries are sampling the large-size tail of the size distribution.This contradicted older theories which had suggested small and Earth-size planets would be relatively infrequent.Based on extrapolations from theKeplerdata, an estimate of around 100 million habitable planets in the Milky Way may be realistic.Some media reports of the TED talk have led to the misunderstanding thatKeplerhad actually found these planets. This was clarified in a letter to the Director of the NASAAmes Research Center, for the Kepler Science Council dated August 2, 2010 states, "Analysis of the current Kepler data does not support the assertion that Kepler has found any Earth-like planets." In 2010, Kepler identified two systems containing objects which are smaller and hotter than their parent stars:KOI 74andKOI 81.These objects are probably low-masswhite dwarfsproduced by previous episodes ofmass transferin their systems. On February 2, 2011, the Kepler team announced the results of analysis of the data taken between 2 May and September 16, 2009.They found 1235 planetary candidates circling 997 host stars. (The numbers that follow assume the candidates are really planets, though the official papers called them only candidates. Independent analysis indicated that at least 90% of them are real planets and not false positives).68 planets were approximately Earth-size, 288super-Earth-size, 662 Neptune-size, 165 Jupiter-size, and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter. In contrast to previous work, roughly 74% of the planets are smaller than Neptune, most likely as a result of previous work finding large planets more easily than smaller ones. That February 2, 2011 release of 1235 exoplanet candidates included 54 that may be in the "habitable zone", including five less than twice the size of Earth.There were previously only two planets thought to be in the "habitable zone", so these new findings represent an enormous expansion of the potential number of "Goldilocks planets" (planets of the right temperature to support liquid water).All of the habitable zone candidates found thus far orbit stars significantly smaller and cooler than the Sun (habitable candidates around Sun-like stars will take several additional years to accumulate the three transits required for detection).Of all the new planet candidates, 68 are 125% ofEarth's size or smaller, or smaller than all previously discovered exoplanets."Earth-size" and "super-Earth-size" is defined as "less than or equal to 2 Earth radii (Re)" [(or, Rp ≤ 2.0 Re) – Table 5].Six such planet candidates [namely: KOI 326.01 (Rp=0.85), KOI 701.03 (Rp=1.73), KOI 268.01 (Rp=1.75), KOI 1026.01 (Rp=1.77), KOI 854.01 (Rp=1.91), KOI 70.03 (Rp=1.96) – Table 6]are in the "habitable zone."A more recent study found that one of these candidates (KOI 326.01) is in fact much larger and hotter than first reported. The frequency of planet observations was highest for exoplanets two to three times Earth-size, and then declined in inverse proportionality to the area of the planet. The best estimate (as of March 2011), after accounting for observational biases, was: 5.4% of stars host Earth-size candidates, 6.8% host super-Earth-size candidates, 19.3% host Neptune-size candidates, and 2.55% host Jupiter-size or larger candidates. Multi-planet systems are common; 17% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 33.9% of all the planets are in multiple planet systems. By December 5, 2011, the Kepler team announced that they had discovered 2,326 planetary candidates, of which 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Compared to the February 2011 figures, the number of Earth-size and super-Earth-size planets increased by 200% and 140% respectively. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars, marking a decrease from the February figure; this was due to the more stringent criteria in use in the December data. On December 20, 2011, the Kepler team announced the discovery of the firstEarth-sizeexoplanets,Kepler-20eandKepler-20f,orbiting aSun-like star,Kepler-20. Based on Kepler's findings, astronomerSeth Shostakestimated in 2011 that "within a thousand light-years of Earth", there are "at least 30,000" habitable planets.Also based on the findings, the Kepler team has estimated that there are "at least 50 billion planets in the Milky Way", of which "at least 500 million" are in thehabitable zone.In March 2011, astronomers at NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL) reported that about "1.4 to 2.7 percent" of all Sun-like stars are expected to have Earth-size planets "within thehabitable zonesof their stars". This means there are "two billion" of these "Earth analogs" in the Milky Way alone. The JPL astronomers also noted that there are "50 billion other galaxies", potentially yielding more than onesextillion"Earth analog" planets if all galaxies have similar numbers of planets to the Milky Way. In January 2012, an international team of astronomers reported that each star in theMilky Waymay host "on average...at least 1.6 planets", suggesting that over 160 billion star-bound planets may exist in the Milky Way.Kepler also recorded distantstellar super-flares, some of which are 10,000 times more powerful than the 1859Carrington event.The superflares may be triggered by close-orbitingJupiter-sized planets.TheTransit Timing Variation(TTV) technique, which was used to discoverKepler-9d, gained popularity for confirming exoplanet discoveries.A planet in a system with four stars was also confirmed, the first time such a system had been discovered. As of 2012[update], there werea total of 2,321 candidates.Of these, 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars. The Kepler team estimated that 5.4% of all stars host Earth-size planet candidates, and that 17% of all stars have multiple planets. According to a study byCaltechastronomers published in January 2013, the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars, resulting in 100–400 billionexoplanets.The study, based on planets orbiting the starKepler-32, suggests thatplanetary systemsmay be common around stars in the Milky Way. The discovery of 461 more candidates was announced on January 7, 2013.The longer Kepler watches, the more planets with long periods it can detect. Since the last Kepler catalog was released in February 2012, the number of candidates discovered in the Kepler data has increased by 20 percent and now totals 2,740 potential planets orbiting 2,036 stars A candidate, newly announced on January 7, 2013, wasKepler-69c(formerly,KOI-172.02), an Earth-size exoplanet orbiting a star similar to the Sun in thehabitable zoneand possibly habitable. In April 2013, a white dwarf was discovered bending the light of its companion red dwarf in theKOI-256star system. In April 2013, NASA announced the discovery of three new Earth-size exoplanets—Kepler-62e,Kepler-62f, andKepler-69c—in thehabitable zonesof their respective host stars,Kepler-62andKepler-69. The new exoplanets are considered prime candidates for possessing liquid water and thus a habitable environment.A more recent analysis has shown that Kepler-69c is likely more analogous to Venus, and thus unlikely to be habitable. On May 15, 2013, NASA announced the space telescope had been crippled by failure of areaction wheelthat keeps it pointed in the right direction. A second wheel had previously failed, and the telescope required three wheels (out of four total) to be operational for the instrument to function properly. Further testing in July and August determined that while Kepler was capable of using its damaged reaction wheels to prevent itself from entering safe mode and of downlinking previously collected science data it was not capable of collecting further science data as previously configured.Scientists working on the Kepler project said there was abacklogof data still to be looked at, and that more discoveries would be made in the following couple of years, despite the setback. Although no new science data from Kepler field had been collected since the problem, an additional sixty-three candidates were announced in July 2013 based on the previously collected observations. In November 2013, the second Kepler science conference was held. The discoveries included the median size of planet candidates getting smaller compared to early 2013, preliminary results of the discovery of a few circumbinary planets and planets in the habitable zone. On February 13, over 530 additional planet candidates were announced residing around single planet systems. Several of them were nearly Earth-sized and located in the habitable zone. This number was further increased by about 400 in June 2014. On February 26, scientists announced that data from Kepler had confirmed the existence of 715 new exoplanets. A new statistical method of confirmation was used called "verification by multiplicity" which is based on how many planets around multiple stars were found to be real planets. This allowed much quicker confirmation of numerous candidates which are part of multiplanetary systems. 95% of the discovered exoplanets were smaller thanNeptuneand four, including Kepler-296f, were less than 2 1/2 the size ofEarthand were inhabitable zoneswhere surface temperatures are suitable for liquidwater. In March, a study found that small planets with orbital periods of less than one day are usually accompanied by at least one additional planet with orbital period of 1–50 days. This study also noted that ultra-short period planets are almost always smaller than 2 Earth radii unless it is a misaligned hot Jupiter. On April 17, the Kepler team announced the discovery ofKepler-186f, the first nearly Earth-sized planet located in the habitable zone. This planet orbits around a red dwarf. In May 2014, K2 observations fields 0 to 13 were announced and described in detail.K2 observations began in June 2014. In July 2014, the first discoveries from K2 field data were reported in the form ofeclipsing binaries. Discoveries were derived from a Kepler engineering data set which was collected prior to campaign 0in preparation to the mainK2mission. On September 23, 2014, NASA reported that theK2mission had completed campaign 1,the first official set of science observations, and that campaign 2was underway. Campaign 3lasted from November 14, 2014, to February 6, 2015, and included "16,375 standard long cadence and 55 standard short cadence targets". By May 10, 2016, the Kepler mission had verified 1,284 new planets.Based on their size, about 550 could be rocky planets. Nine of these orbit in their stars'habitable zone:Kepler-560b,Kepler-705b,Kepler-1229b,Kepler-1410b,Kepler-1455b,Kepler-1544 b,Kepler-1593b,Kepler-1606b, andKepler-1638b. The Kepler team originally promised to release data within one year of observations.However, this plan was changed after launch, with data being scheduled for release up to three years after its collection.This resulted in considerable criticism,leading the Kepler science team to release the third quarter of their data one year and nine months after collection.The data through September 2010 (quarters 4, 5, and 6) was made public in January 2012. Periodically, the Kepler team releases a list of candidates (Kepler Objects of Interest, or KOIs) to the public. Using this information, a team of astronomers collectedradial velocitydata using theSOPHIE échelle spectrographto confirm the existence of the candidate KOI-428b in 2010, later namedKepler-40b.In 2011, the same team confirmed candidate KOI-423b, later namedKepler-39b. Since December 2010, Kepler mission data has been used for thePlanet Huntersproject, which allows volunteers to look for transit events in the light curves of Kepler images to identify planets that computeralgorithmsmight miss.By June 2011, users had found sixty-nine potential candidates that were previously unrecognized by the Kepler mission team.The team has plans to publicly credit amateurs who spot such planets. In January 2012, theBBCprogramStargazing Liveaired a public appeal for volunteers to analyse Planethunters.org data for potential new exoplanets. This led two amateur astronomers—one inPeterborough, England—to discover a newNeptune-sized exoplanet, to be named Threapleton Holmes B.One hundred thousand other volunteers were also engaged in the search by late January, analyzing over one million Kepler images by early 2012.One such exoplanet,PH1b(or Kepler-64b from its Kepler designation), was discovered in 2012. A second exoplanet,PH2b(Kepler-86b) was discovered in 2013. In April 2017,ABCStargazing Live, a variation of BBCStargazing Live, launched the Zooniverse project "Exoplanet Explorers". While Planethunters.org worked with archived data, Exoplanet Explorers used recently downlinked data from the K2 mission. On the first day of the project, 184 transit candidates were identified that passed simple tests. On the second day, the research team identified a star system, later namedK2-138, with a Sun-like star and foursuper-Earthsin a tight orbit. In the end, volunteers helped to identify 90 exoplanet candidates.Thecitizen scientiststhat helped discover the new star system will be added as co-authors in the research paper when published. Exoplanets discovered usingKepler'sdata, but confirmed by outside researchers, include Kepler-39b,Kepler-40b,Kepler-41b,Kepler-43b,Kepler-44b,Kepler-45b,as well as the planets orbitingKepler-223andKepler-42.The "KOI" acronym indicates that the star is aKeplerObject ofInterest. TheKepler Input Catalogis a publicly searchable database of roughly 13.2 million targets used for the Kepler Spectral Classification Program and the Kepler mission.The catalog alone is not used for finding Kepler targets, because only a portion of the listed stars (about one-third of the catalog) can be observed by the spacecraft. Kepler has been assigned anobservatory code(C55) in order to report itsastrometricobservations ofsmall Solar System bodiesto theMinor Planet Center. In 2013 the alternativeNEOKeplermission was proposed, a search fornear-Earth objects, in particularpotentially hazardous asteroids(PHAs). Its unique orbit and larger field of view than existing survey telescopes allow it to look for objects inside Earth's orbit. It was predicted a 12-month survey could make a significant contribution to the hunt for PHAs as well as potentially locating targets for NASA'sAsteroid Redirect Mission.Kepler's first discovery in the Solar System, however, was(506121) 2016 BP81, a 200-kilometer coldclassical Kuiper belt objectlocatedbeyond the orbit of Neptune. On October 30, 2018,NASAannounced that the Kepler space telescope, having run out of fuel, and after nine years of service and the discovery of over 2,600exoplanets, has been officially retired, and will maintain its current, safe orbit, away from Earth.The spacecraft was deactivated with a "goodnight" command sent from the mission's control center at theLaboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physicson November 15, 2018.Kepler's retirement coincides with the 388th anniversary ofJohannes Kepler's death in 1630.

TheJames Webb Space Telescope(JWST) is aspace telescopedesigned to conductinfrared astronomy. It is the largest telescope in space, and is equipped with high-resolution and high-sensitivity instruments, allowing it to view objects too old,distant, or faint for theHubble Space Telescope.This enables investigations across many fields ofastronomyandcosmology, such as observation of thefirst starsand theformation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization ofpotentially habitable exoplanets. Although the Webb's mirror diameter is 2.7 times larger than that of the Hubble Space Telescope, it only produces images of comparableresolutionbecause it observes in the infrared spectrum, of longer wavelength than the Hubble's visible spectrum. The longer the wavelength the telescope is designed to observe, the larger the information-gathering surface (mirrors in the infrared spectrum or antenna area in the millimeter and radio ranges) required for the same resolution. The Webb was launched on 25 December 2021 on anAriane 5rocket fromKourou, French Guiana. In January 2022 it arrived at its destination, a solar orbit near the Sun–EarthL2Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth.The telescope's first imagewas released to the public on 11 July 2022. The U.S.National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) led Webb's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) and theCanadian Space Agency(CSA). The NASAGoddard Space Flight CenterinMarylandmanaged telescope development, while theSpace Telescope Science InstituteinBaltimoreon theHomewood Campus of Johns Hopkins Universityoperates Webb. The primary contractor for the project wasNorthrop Grumman. Thetelescope is namedafterJames E. Webb, who was theadministrator of NASAfrom 1961 to 1968 during theMercury,Gemini, andApolloprograms. Webb'sprimary mirrorconsists of 18 hexagonalmirror segmentsmade of gold-platedberyllium, which together create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives Webb alight-collecting areaof about 25 m2(270 sq ft), about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in thenear ultravioletandvisible(0.1 to 0.8μm), andnear infrared(0.8–2.5 μm)spectra, Webb observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6–28.5 μm).The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (−223 °C; −370 °F), so that theinfrared radiation emittedby the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. Its five-layersunshieldprotects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon. Initial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays. A major redesign was carried out in 2005, with construction completed in 2016, followed by years of exhaustive testing, at a total cost of US$10 billion. The mass of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is about half that of theHubble Space Telescope. Webb has a 6.5-meter-diameter (21-foot) gold-coated berylliumprimary mirrormade up of 18 separate hexagonal mirrors. The mirror has a polished area of 26.3 m2(283 sq ft), of which 0.9 m2(9.7 sq ft) is obscured by the secondary support struts,giving a total collecting area of 25.4 m2(273 sq ft). This is over six times larger than the collecting area of Hubble's 2.4 m (7.9 ft) diameter mirror, which has a collecting area of 4.0 m2(43 sq ft). The mirror has a gold coating to provide infraredreflectivity, covered by a thin layer of glass for durability. Webb is designed primarily for near-infrared astronomy, but can also see orange and red visible light, and the mid-infrared region, depending on the instrument being used.It can detect objects up to 100 times fainter than Hubble can, and objects much earlier in thehistory of the universe, back toredshiftz≈20 (about 180 million yearscosmic timeafter theBig Bang).For comparison, theearliest starsare thought to have formed between z≈30 and z≈20 (100–180 million years cosmic time),and the first galaxies may have formed around redshift z≈15 (about 270 million years cosmic time). Hubble is unable to see further back than very earlyreionizationat about z≈11.1 (galaxyGN-z11, 400 million years cosmic time). The design emphasizes the near to mid-infrared for several reasons: Ground-based telescopes must look throughEarth's atmosphere, which is opaque in many infrared bands (see figure at right). Even where the atmosphere is transparent, many of the target chemical compounds, such as water, carbon dioxide, andmethane, are present in the Earth's atmosphere and interfere with observations. Existing space telescopes such as Hubble cannot study these bands since their mirrors are at a temperature high enough to emit significant infrared radiation; for example the Hubble mirror is maintained at about 15 °C [288 K; 59 °F], so that the telescope itself radiates strongly in the relevant infrared bands. Webb can also observe objects in theSolar Systemat an angle of more than 85° from the Sun and having an apparentangular rate of motionless than 0.03 arc seconds per second.[a]This includes Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, theirsatellites, andcomets,asteroidsandminor planetsat or beyond theorbit of Mars. Webb has sufficient near-IR and mid-IR sensitivity to be able to observe virtually all knownKuiper Belt Objects.In addition, it can observe opportunistic and unplanned targets such assupernovaeandgamma ray burstswithin 48 hours of a decision to do so. Webb operates in ahalo orbit, circling around a point in space known as the Sun–Earth L2Lagrange point, approximately 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) beyond Earth's orbit around the Sun. Its actual position varies between about 250,000 and 832,000 km (155,000–517,000 mi) from L2as it orbits, keeping it out of both Earth and Moon's shadow. By way of comparison, Hubble orbits 550 km (340 mi) above Earth's surface, and the Moon is roughly 400,000 km (250,000 mi) from Earth. Objects near this Sun–EarthL2point can orbit the Sun in synchrony with the Earth, allowing the telescope to remain at a roughly constant distancewith continuous orientation of its sunshield andequipment bustoward the Sun, Earth and Moon. Combined with its wide shadow-avoiding orbit, the telescope can simultaneously block incoming heat and light from all three of these bodies and avoid even the smallest changes of temperature from Earth and Moon shadows that would affect the structure, yet still maintain uninterrupted solar power and Earth communications on its sun-facing side. This arrangement keeps the temperature of the spacecraft constant and below the 50 K (−223 °C; −370 °F) necessary for faint infrared observations. To make observations in theinfraredspectrum, Webb must be kept under 50 K (−223.2 °C; −369.7 °F); otherwise infrared radiation from the telescope itself would overwhelm its instruments. Its large sunshield blocks light and heat from the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and its position near the Sun–Earth L2keeps all three bodies on the same side of the spacecraft at all times.Its halo orbit around theL2pointavoids the shadow of the Earth and Moon, maintaining a constant environment for the sunshield and solar arrays.The resulting stable temperature for the structures on the dark side is critical to maintaining precise alignment of the primary mirror segments. The sunshield consists of five layers, each approximately as thin as a human hair.Each layer is made ofKapton Efilm, coated with aluminum on both sides. The two outermost layers have an additional coating ofdoped siliconon the Sun-facing sides, to better reflect the Sun's heat back into space.The sunshield has an effective sun protection factor, or SPF, of 1,000,000, compared to suntan lotion with a range of 8 to 50.Accidental tears of the delicate film structure during deployment testing in 2018 led to further delays to the telescope deployment. The sunshield was designed to be folded twelve times so that it would fit within theAriane 5rocket'spayload fairing, which is 4.57 m (15.0 ft) in diameter, and 16.19 m (53.1 ft) long. The shield's fully deployed dimensions were planned as 14.162 m × 21.197 m (46.46 ft × 69.54 ft). Keeping within the shadow of the sunshield limits thefield of regardof Webb at any given time. The telescope can see 40 percent of the sky from any one position, but can see all of the sky over a period of six months. Webb'sprimary mirroris a 6.5 m (21 ft)-diameter gold-coated beryllium reflector with a collecting area of 25.4 m2(273 sq ft). If it had been designed as a single, large mirror, it would have been too large for existing launch vehicles. The mirror is therefore composed of 18 hexagonal segments (a technique pioneered byGuido Horn d'Arturo), which unfolded after the telescope was launched. Image planewavefront sensingthroughphase retrievalis used to position themirror segmentsin the correct location using preciseactuators. Subsequent to this initial configuration, they only need occasional updates every few days to retain optimal focus.This is unlike terrestrial telescopes, for example theKeck telescopes, which must continually adjust their mirror segments usingactive opticsto overcome the effects of gravitational and wind loading.The Webb telescope uses 132 small actuation motors to position and adjust the optics.The actuators can position the mirror with 10nanometeraccuracy. Webb's optical design is athree-mirror anastigmat,which makes use of curved secondary and tertiary mirrors to deliver images that are free fromoptical aberrationsover a wide field. The secondary mirror is 0.74 m (2.4 ft) in diameter. In addition, there is a fine steering mirror which can adjust its position many times per second to provideimage stabilization. Point light sources in images taken by Webb have sixdiffraction spikesplus two fainter ones, due to the hexagonal shape of the primary mirror segments. TheIntegrated Science Instrument Module(ISIM) is a framework that provides electrical power, computing resources, cooling capability as well as structural stability to the Webb telescope. It is made with bonded graphite-epoxy composite attached to the underside of Webb's telescope structure. The ISIM holds the four science instruments and a guide camera. NIRCam and MIRI feature starlight-blockingcoronagraphsfor observation of faint targets such asextrasolar planetsandcircumstellar disksvery close to bright stars. Thespacecraft busis the primary support component of the JWST, hosting a multitude of computing, communication, electric power, propulsion, and structural parts.Along with the sunshield, it forms the spacecraft element of thespace telescope.The spacecraft bus is on the Sun-facing "warm" side of the sunshield and operates at a temperature of about 300 K (27 °C; 80 °F). The structure of the spacecraft bus has a mass of 350 kg (770 lb), and must support the 6,200 kg (13,700 lb) space telescope. It is made primarily of graphite composite material.The assembly was completed in California in 2015. It was integrated with the rest of the space telescope leading to its 2021 launch. The spacecraft bus can rotate the telescope with a pointing precision of onearcsecond, and isolates vibration to two milliarcseconds. Webb has two pairs of rocket engines (one pair for redundancy) to make course corrections on the way to L2and forstation keeping– maintaining the correct position in the halo orbit. Eight smaller thrusters are used forattitude control– the correct pointing of the spacecraft.The engines usehydrazinefuel (159 liters or 42 U.S. gallons at launch) anddinitrogen tetroxideas oxidizer (79.5 liters or 21.0 U.S. gallons at launch). Webb is not intended to be serviced in space. A crewed mission to repair or upgrade the observatory, as was done for Hubble, would not be possible,and according to NASA Associate AdministratorThomas Zurbuchen, despite best efforts, an uncrewed remote mission was found to be beyond available technology at the time Webb was designed.During the long Webb testing period, NASA officials referred to the idea of a servicing mission, but no plans were announced.Since the successful launch, NASA has stated that nevertheless limited accommodation was made to facilitate future servicing missions. These accommodations included precise guidance markers in the form of crosses on the surface of Webb, for use by remote servicing missions, as well as refillable fuel tanks, removable heat protectors, and accessible attachment points. Webb uses a modified version ofJavaScript, called Nombas ScriptEase 5.00e, for its operations; it follows theECMAScriptstandard and "allows for a modular design flow, where on-board scripts call lower-level scripts that are defined as functions". Furthermore, "The script interpreter is run by the flight software, which is written inC++. The flight software operates the spacecraft and the science instruments." The desire for a large infrared space telescope is decades old. In the United States, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (later called theSpitzer Space Telescope) was planned while the Space Shuttle was in development, and the potential for infrared astronomy was acknowledged at that time.Unlike ground telescopes, space observatories are free from atmospheric absorption of infrared light. Space observatories opened a "new sky" for astronomers. However, there is a challenge involved in the design of infrared telescopes: they need to stay extremely cold, and the longer the wavelength of infrared, the colder they need to be. If not, the background heat of the device itself overwhelms the detectors, making it effectively blind. This can be overcome by careful design. One method is to put the key instruments in adewarwith an extremely cold substance, such asliquid helium. The coolant will slowly vaporize, limiting the lifetime of the instrument from as short as a few months to a few years at most. It is also possible to maintain a low temperature by designing the spacecraft to enable near-infrared observations without a supply of coolant, as with the extended missions of the Spitzer Space Telescope and theWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, which operated at reduced capacity after coolant depletion. Another example is Hubble'sNear Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer(NICMOS) instrument, which started out using a block ofnitrogen icethat depleted after a couple of years, but was then replaced during theSTS-109servicing mission with acryocoolerthat worked continuously. The Webb Space Telescope is designed to cool itself without a dewar, using a combination of sunshields and radiators, with the mid-infrared instrument using an additional cryocooler. Webb's delays and cost increases have been compared to those of its predecessor, theHubble Space Telescope. When Hubble formally started in 1972, it had an estimated development cost of US$300 million (equivalent to $2,255,131,000 in 2024), but by the time it was sent into orbit in 1990, the cost was about four times that. In addition, new instruments and servicing missions increased the cost to at least US$9 billion by 2006(equivalent to $14,037,801,000 in 2024). Discussions of a Hubble follow-on started in the 1980s, but serious planning began in the early 1990s.TheHi-Ztelescope concept was developed between 1989 and 1994:a fully baffled[b]4 m (13 ft) aperture infrared telescope that would recede to an orbit at 3Astronomical unit(AU).This distant orbit would have benefited from reduced light noise fromzodiacal dust.Other early plans called for a NEXUS precursor telescope mission. Correcting theflawed opticsof the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in its first years played a significant role in the birth of Webb.In 1993, NASA conductedSTS-61,the Space Shuttle missionthat replaced HST's camera and installed a retrofit for its imaging spectrograph to compensate for thespherical aberrationin itsprimary mirror. The HST & Beyond Committee was formed in 1994 "to study possible missions and programs for optical-ultraviolet astronomy in space for the first decades of the 21st century".Emboldened by HST's success, its 1996 report explored the concept of a larger and much colder, infrared-sensitive telescope that could reach back in cosmic time to the birth of the first galaxies. This high-priority science goal was beyond the HST's capability because, as a warm telescope, it is blinded by infrared emission from its own optical system. In addition to recommendations to extend the HST mission to 2005 and to develop technologies for finding planets around other stars, NASA embraced the chief recommendation of HST & Beyondfor a large, cold space telescope (radiatively cooled far below 0 °C), and began the planning process for the future Webb telescope. Preparation for the 2000Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey(a literature review produced by theUnited States National Research Councilthat includes identifying research priorities and making recommendations for the upcoming decade) included further development of the scientific program for what became known as the Next Generation Space Telescope,and advancements in relevant technologies by NASA. As it matured, studying the birth of galaxies in the younguniverse, and searching for planets around other stars – the prime goals coalesced as "Origins" by HST & Beyond became prominent. As hoped, the NGST received the highest ranking in the 2000 Decadal Survey. Anadministrator of NASA,Dan Goldin, coined the phrase "faster, better, cheaper", and opted for the next big paradigm shift for astronomy, namely, breaking the barrier of a single mirror. That meant going from "eliminate moving parts" to "learn to live with moving parts" (i.e. segmented optics). With the goal to reduce mass density tenfold,silicon carbidewith a very thin layer of glass on top was first looked at, butberylliumwas selected at the end. The mid-1990s era of "faster, better, cheaper" produced the NGST concept, with an 8 m (26 ft) aperture to be flown toL2, roughly estimated to cost US$500 million.In 1997, NASA worked with the Goddard Space Flight Center,Ball Aerospace & Technologies,andTRWto conduct technical requirement and cost studies of the three different concepts, and in 1999 selectedLockheed Martinand TRW for preliminary concept studies.Launch was at that time planned for 2007, but the launch date was pushed back many times (see tablefurther down). In 2002, the project was renamed after NASA's second administrator (1961–1968),James E. Webb(1906–1992).Webb led the agency during theApollo programand established scientific research as a core NASA activity. In 2003, NASA awarded TRW the US$824.8 million prime contract for Webb. The design called for a de-scoped 6.1 m (20 ft) primary mirror and a launch date of 2010.Later that year, TRW was acquired byNorthrop Grummanin a hostile bid and became Northrop Grumman Space Technology. Development was managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, withJohn C. Matheras its project scientist. The primary contractor was Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, responsible for developing and building the spacecraft element, which included thesatellite bus, sunshield, Deployable Tower Assembly (DTA) which connects theOptical Telescope Elementto the spacecraft bus, and the Mid Boom Assembly (MBA) which helps to deploy the large sunshields on orbit,whileBall Aerospace & Technologieswas subcontracted to develop and build the OTE itself, and theIntegrated Science Instrument Module(ISIM). Cost growth revealed in spring 2005 led to an August 2005 re-planning.The primary technical outcomes of the re-planning were significant changes in the integration and test plans, a 22-month launch delay (from 2011 to 2013), and elimination of system-level testing for observatory modes at wavelengths shorter than 1.7 μm. Other major features of the observatory were unchanged. Following the re-planning, the project was independently reviewed in April 2006. In the 2005 re-plan, the life-cycle cost of the project was estimated at US$4.5 billion. This comprised approximately US$3.5 billion for design, development, launch and commissioning, and approximately US$1.0 billion for ten years of operations.The ESA agreed in 2004 to contributing about €300 million, including the launch.The CSA pledged CA$39 million in 2007and in 2012 delivered its contributions in equipment to point the telescope and detect atmospheric conditions on distant planets. In January 2007, nine of the ten technology development items in the project successfully passed a Non-Advocate Review.These technologies were deemed sufficiently mature to retire significant risks in the project. The remaining technology development item (theMIRIcryocooler) completed its technology maturation milestone in April 2007. This technology review represented the beginning step in the process that ultimately moved the project into its detailed design phase (Phase C). By May 2007, costs were still on target.In March 2008, the project successfully completed its Preliminary Design Review (PDR). In April 2008, the project passed the Non-Advocate Review. Other passed reviews include theIntegrated Science Instrument Modulereview in March 2009, theOptical Telescope Elementreview completed in October 2009, and the Sunshield review completed in January 2010. In April 2010, the telescope passed the technical portion of its Mission Critical Design Review (MCDR). Passing the MCDR signified the integrated observatory can meet all science and engineering requirements for its mission.The MCDR encompassed all previous design reviews. The project schedule underwent review during the months following the MCDR, in a process called the Independent Comprehensive Review Panel, which led to a re-plan of the mission aiming for a 2015 launch, but as late as 2018. By 2010, cost over-runs were impacting other projects, though Webb itself remained on schedule. By 2011, the Webb project was in the final design and fabrication phase (Phase C). Assembly of the hexagonal segments of the primary mirror, which was done via robotic arm, began in November 2015 and was completed on 3 February 2016. The secondary mirror was installed on 3 March 2016.Final construction of the Webb telescope was completed in November 2016, after which extensive testing procedures began. In March 2018, NASA delayed Webb's launch an additional two years to May 2020 after the telescope's sunshield ripped during a practice deployment and the sunshield's cables did not sufficiently tighten. In June 2018, NASA delayed the launch by an additional 10 months to March 2021, based on the assessment of the independent review board convened after the failed March 2018 test deployment.The review identified that Webb launch and deployment had 344 potentialsingle-point failures– tasks that had no alternative or means of recovery if unsuccessful, and therefore had to succeed for the telescope to work.In August 2019, the mechanical integration of the telescope was completed, something that was scheduled to be done 12 years before in 2007. After construction was completed, Webb underwent final tests at Northrop Grumman's historicSpace Parkin Redondo Beach, California.A ship carrying the telescope left California on 26 September 2021, passed through thePanama Canal, and arrived inFrench Guianaon 12 October 2021. NASA's lifetime cost for the project is[when?]expected to be US$9.7 billion, of which US$8.8 billion was spent on spacecraft design and development and US$861 million is planned to support five years of mission operations.Representatives from ESA and CSA stated their project contributions amount to approximately €700 million and CA$200 million, respectively. A study in 1984 by the Space Science Board estimated that to build a next-generation infrared observatory in orbit would cost US$4 billion (US$7B in 2006 dollars, or $10B in 2020 dollars).While this came close to the final cost of Webb, the first NASA design considered in the late 1990s was more modest, aiming for a $1 billion price tag over 10 years of construction. Over time this design expanded, added funding for contingencies, and had scheduling delays. By 2008, when the project entered preliminary design review and was formally confirmed for construction, over US$1 billion had already been spent on developing the telescope, and the total budget was estimated at US$5 billion (equivalent to $8.05 billion in 2024).In summer 2010, the mission passed its Critical Design Review (CDR) with excellent grades on all technical matters, but schedule and cost slips at that time prompted Maryland U.S. SenatorBarbara Mikulskito call for external review of the project. The Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) chaired by J. Casani (JPL) found that the earliest possible launch date was in late 2015 at an extra cost of US$1.5 billion (for a total of US$6.5 billion). They also pointed out that this would have required extra funding in FY2011 and FY2012 and that any later launch date would lead to a higher total cost. On 6 July 2011, the United States House of Representatives' appropriations committee on Commerce, Justice, and Science moved to cancel the James Webb project by proposing an FY2012 budget that removed US$1.9 billion from NASA's overall budget, of which roughly one quarter was for Webb.US$3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production.This budget proposal was approved by subcommittee vote the following day. The committee charged that the project was "billions of dollars over budget and plagued by poor management".In response, theAmerican Astronomical Societyissued a statement in support of Webb,as did Senator Mikulski.A number of editorials supporting Webb appeared in the international press during 2011 as well.In November 2011, Congress reversed plans to cancel Webb and instead capped additional funding to complete the project at US$8 billion. While similar issues had affected other major NASA projects such as the Hubble telescope, some scientists expressed concerns about growing costs and schedule delays for the Webb telescope, worrying that its budget might be competing with those of other space science programs.A 2010Naturearticle described Webb as "the telescope that ate astronomy".NASA continued to defend the budget and timeline of the program to Congress. In 2018,Gregory L. Robinsonwas appointed as the new director of the Webb program.Robinson was credited with raising the program's schedule efficiency (how many measures were completed on time) from 50% to 95%.For his role in improving the performance of the Webb program, Robinsons's supervisor,Thomas Zurbuchen, called him "the most effective leader of a mission I have ever seen in the history of NASA".In July 2022, after Webb's commissioning process was complete and it began transmitting its first data, Robinson retired following a 33-year career at NASA. On 27 March 2018, NASA pushed back the launch to May 2020 or later,with a final cost estimate to come after a new launch window was determined with the ESA.In 2019, its mission cost cap was increased by US$800 million.After launch windows were paused in 2020 due to theCOVID-19 pandemic,Webb was launched at the end of 2021, with a total cost of just under US$10 billion. No single area drove the cost. For future large telescopes, there are five major areas critical to controlling overall cost: NASA, ESA and CSA have collaborated on the telescope since 1996. ESA's participation in construction and launch was approved by its members in 2003 and an agreement was signed between ESA and NASA in 2007. In exchange for full partnership, representation and access to the observatory for its astronomers, ESA is providing the NIRSpec instrument, the Optical Bench Assembly of the MIRI instrument, anAriane 5 ECAlauncher, and manpower to support operations.The CSA provided the Fine Guidance Sensor and the Near-Infrared Imager Slitless Spectrograph and manpower to support operations. Several thousand scientists, engineers, and technicians spanning 15 countries have contributed to the build, test and integration of Webb.A total of 258 companies, government agencies, and academic institutions participated in the pre-launch project; 142 from the United States, 104 from 12 European countries (including 21 from the U.K., 16 from France, 12 from Germany and 7 international),and 12 from Canada.Other countries as NASA partners, such as Australia, were involved in post-launch operation. Participating countries: In 2002, NASA administrator (2001–2004)Sean O'Keefemade the decision to name the telescope afterJames E. Webb, the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during theMercury,Gemini, and much of theApollo programs. In 2015, concerns were raised around Webb's possible role in thelavender scare, the mid-20th-century persecution by the U.S. government targetinghomosexualsinfederal employment.In 2022, NASA released a report of an investigation,based on an examination of more than 50,000 documents. The report found "no available evidence directly links Webb to any actions or follow-up related to the firing of individuals for their sexual orientation", either in his time in the State Department or at NASA. The James Webb Space Telescope has four key goals: These goals can be accomplished more effectively by observation in near-infrared light rather than light in the visible part of the spectrum. For this reason, Webb's instruments will not measure visible or ultraviolet light like the Hubble Telescope, but will have a much greater capacity to performinfrared astronomy. Webb will be sensitive to a range of wavelengths from 0.6 to 28 μm (corresponding respectively to orange light and deep infrared radiation at about 100 K or −173 °C). Webb may be used to gather information on the dimming light of starKIC 8462852, which was discovered in 2015, and has some abnormal light-curve properties. Additionally, it will be able to tell if an exoplanet has methane in its atmosphere, allowing astronomers to determine whether or not the methane is abiosignature. Webb orbits the Sun near the secondLagrange point(L2) of the Sun–Earth system, which is 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) farther from the Sun than the Earth's orbit, and about four times farther than the Moon's orbit. Normally an object circling the Sun farther out than Earth would take longer than one year to complete its orbit. But near theL2point, the combined gravitational pull of the Earth and the Sun allow a spacecraft to orbit the Sun in the same time that it takes the Earth. Staying close to Earth allows data rates to be much faster for a given size of antenna. The telescope circles about the Sun–Earth L2point in ahalo orbit, which is inclined with respect to theecliptic, has a radius varying between about 250,000 km (160,000 mi) and 832,000 km (517,000 mi), and takes about half a year to complete.Since L2is just an equilibrium point with no gravitational pull, a halo orbit is not an orbit in the usual sense: the spacecraft is actually in orbit around the Sun, and the halo orbit can be thought of as controlled drifting to remain in the vicinity of the L2point.This requires somestation-keeping: around2.5 m/sper yearfrom the total∆vbudget of93 m/s.: 10Two sets of thrusters constitute the observatory's propulsion system.Because the thrusters are located solely on the Sun-facing side of the observatory, all station-keeping operations are designed to slightly undershoot the required amount of thrust in order to avoid pushing Webb beyond the semi-stableL2point, a situation which would be unrecoverable. Randy Kimble, the Integration and Test Project Scientist for the JWST, compared the precise station-keeping of Webb to "Sisyphus[...] rolling this rock up the gentle slope near the top of the hill – we never want it to roll over the crest and get away from him". Webb is the formal successor to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and since its primary emphasis is oninfrared astronomy, it is also a successor to theSpitzer Space Telescope. Webb will far surpass both those telescopes, being able to see many more and much older stars and galaxies.Observing in the infrared spectrum is a key technique for achieving this, because ofcosmological redshift, and because it better penetrates obscuring dust and gas. This allows observation of dimmer, cooler objects. Since water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs most infrared, ground-based infrared astronomy is limited to narrow wavelength ranges where the atmosphere absorbs less strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere itself radiates in the infrared spectrum, often overwhelming light from the object being observed. This makes a space telescope preferable for infrared observation. The more distant an object is, the younger it appears; its light has taken longer to reach human observers. Because theuniverse is expanding, as the light travels it becomes red-shifted, and objects at extreme distances are therefore easier to see if viewed in the infrared.Webb's infrared capabilities are expected to let it see back in time to the first galaxies forming just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. Infrared radiation can pass more freely through regions ofcosmic dustthat scatter visible light. Observations in infrared allow the study of objects and regions of space which would be obscured by gas and dust in thevisible spectrum,such as themolecular cloudswhere stars are born, thecircumstellar disksthat give rise to planets, and the cores ofactive galaxies. Relatively cool objects (temperatures less than several thousand degrees) emit their radiation primarily in the infrared, as described byPlanck's law. As a result, most objects that are cooler than stars are better studied in the infrared.This includes the clouds of theinterstellar medium,brown dwarfs,planetsboth in our own and other solar systems,comets, andKuiper belt objectsthat will be observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). Some of the missions in infrared astronomy that impacted Webb development wereSpitzerand theWilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe(WMAP).Spitzer showed the importance of mid-infrared, which is helpful for tasks such as observing dust disks around stars.Also, the WMAP probe showed the universe was "lit up" at redshift 17, further underscoring the importance of the mid-infrared.Both these missions were launched in the early 2000s, in time to influence Webb development. TheSpace Telescope Science Institute(STScI), inBaltimore, Maryland, on theHomewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University, was selected in 2003 as the Science and Operations Center (S&OC) for Webb with an initial budget of US$162.2 million intended to support operations through the first year after launch.In this capacity, STScI was to be responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and delivery of data products to the astronomical community. Data was to be transmitted from Webb to the ground via theNASA Deep Space Network, processed and calibrated at STScI, and then distributed online to astronomers worldwide. Similar to how Hubble is operated, anyone, anywhere in the world, will be allowed to submit proposals for observations. Each year several committees of astronomers willpeer reviewthe submitted proposals to select the projects to observe in the coming year. The authors of the chosen proposals will typically have one year of private access to the new observations, after which the data will become publicly available for download by anyone from the online archive at STScI. The bandwidth and digital throughput of the satellite is designed to operate at 458 gigabits of data per day for the length of the mission (equivalent to a sustained rate of 5.42Mbps).Most of the data processing on the telescope is done by conventional single-board computers.The digitization of the analog data from the instruments is performed by the custom SIDECAR ASIC (System for Image Digitization, Enhancement, Control And RetrievalApplication Specific Integrated Circuit). NASA stated that the SIDECAR ASIC will include all the functions of a 9.1 kg (20 lb) instrument box in a 3 cm (1.2 in) package and consume only 11 milliwatts of power.Since this conversion must be done close to the detectors, on the cold side of the telescope, the low power dissipation is crucial for maintaining the low temperature required for optimal operation of Webb. The telescope is equipped with asolid-state drive(SSD) with a capacity of 68 GB, used as temporary storage for data collected from its scientific instruments. By the end of the 10-year mission, the usable capacity of the drive is expected to decrease to 60 GB due to the effects of radiation and read/write operations. The C3[c]mirror segment suffered amicrometeoroidstrike from a large dust mote-sized particle between 23 and 25 May 2022, the fifth and largest strike since launch, reported 8 June 2022, which required engineers to compensate for the strike using amirror actuator.Despite the strike, a NASA characterization report states "all JWST observing modes have been reviewed and confirmed to be ready for science use" as of 10 July 2022.Micrometeoroids strike Webb an average of once or twice per month, and only the May 2022 strike caused noticeable damage.After that strike, mission personnel implemented a strategy to change Webb's observations to reduce the risk of further damage. The strategy is to avoid pointing the mirror toward "micrometeoroid avoidance zones" at particular points along Webb's orbit. The launch (designatedAriane flight VA256) took place as scheduled at 12:20 UTC on 25 December 2021 on anAriane 5rocket that lifted off from theGuiana Space CentreinFrench Guiana.The telescope was confirmed to be receiving power, starting a two-week deployment phase of its partsand traveling to its target destination.The telescope was released from the upper stage 27 minutes 7 seconds after launch, beginning a 30-day adjustment to place the telescope in aLissajous orbitaround theL2Lagrange point. The telescope was launched with slightly less speed than needed to reach its final orbit, and slowed down as it travelled away from Earth, in order to reach L2with only the velocity needed to enter its orbit there. The telescope reached L2on 24 January 2022. The flight included three planned course corrections to adjust its speed and direction. This is because the observatory could recover from underthrust (going too slowly), but could not recover from overthrust (going too fast) – to protect highly temperature-sensitive instruments, the sunshield must remain between telescope and Sun, so the spacecraft could not turn around or use its thrusters to slow down. AnL2orbit isunstable, so JWST needs to use propellant to maintain its halo orbit around L2 (known asstation-keeping) to prevent the telescope from drifting away from its orbital position.It was designed to carry enough propellant for 10 years,but the precision of the Ariane 5 launch and the first midcourse correction were credited with saving enough onboard fuel that JWST may be able to maintain its orbit for around 20 years instead.Space.comcalled the launch "flawless". Webb was released from the rocket upper stage 27 minutes after a flawless launch.Starting 31 minutes after launch, and continuing for about 13 days, Webb began the process of deploying its solar array, antenna, sunshield, and mirrors.Nearly all deployment actions are commanded by the Space Telescope Science Institute inBaltimore, Maryland, except for two early automatic steps, solar panel unfolding and communication antenna deployment.The mission was designed to give ground controllers flexibility to change or modify the deployment sequence in case of problems. At 7:50p.m. EST on 25 December 2021, about 12 hours after launch, the telescope's pair of primary rockets began firing for 65 minutes to make the first of three planned mid-course corrections.On day two, the high gain communication antenna deployed automatically. On 27 December 2021, at 60 hours after launch, Webb's rockets fired for nine minutes and 27 seconds to make the second of three mid-course corrections for the telescope to arrive at its L2destination.On 28 December 2021, three days after launch, mission controllers began the multi-day deployment of Webb's all-important sunshield. On 30 December 2021, controllers successfully completed two more steps in unpacking the observatory. First, commands deployed the aft "momentum flap", a device that provides balance against solar pressure on the sunshield, saving fuel by reducing the need for thruster firing to maintain Webb's orientation. On 31 December 2021, the ground team extended the two telescoping "mid booms" from the left and right sides of the observatory.The left side deployed in 3 hours and 19 minutes; the right side took 3 hours and 42 minutes.Commands to separate and tension the membranes followed between 3 and 4 January and were successful.On 5 January 2022, mission control successfully deployed the telescope's secondary mirror, which locked itself into place to a tolerance of about one and a half millimeters. The last step of structural deployment was to unfold the wings of the primary mirror. Each panel consists of three primary mirror segments and had to be folded to allow the space telescope to be installed in thefairingof the Ariane rocket for the launch of the telescope. On 7 January 2022, NASA deployed and locked in place the port-side wing,and on 8 January, the starboard-side mirror wing. This successfully completed the structural deployment of the observatory. On 24 January 2022, at 2:00p.m. Eastern Standard Time,nearly a month after launch, a third and final course correction took place, inserting Webb into its plannedhalo orbitaround the Sun–Earth L2point. The MIRI instrument has four observing modes – imaging, low-resolution spectroscopy, medium-resolution spectroscopy and coronagraphic imaging. "On Aug. 24, a mechanism that supports medium-resolution spectroscopy (MRS), exhibited what appears to be increased friction during setup for a science observation. This mechanism is a grating wheel that allows scientists to select between short, medium, and longer wavelengths when making observations using the MRS mode", said NASA in a press statement. On 12 January 2022, while still in transit, mirror alignment began. The primary mirror segments and secondary mirror were moved away from their protective launch positions. This took about 10 days, because the 132actuatormotors are designed to fine-tune the mirror positions at microscopic accuracy (10nanometerincrements) and must each move over 1.2 million increments (12.5 mm) during initial alignment. Mirror alignment requires each of the 18 mirror segments, and the secondary mirror, to be positioned to within 50 nanometers. NASA compares the required accuracy by analogy: "If the Webb primary mirror were the size of the United States, each [mirror] segment would be the size of Texas, and the team would need to line the height of those Texas-sized segments up with each other to an accuracy of about 1.5 inches". Mirror alignment was a complex operation split into seven phases, that had been repeatedly rehearsed using a 1:6 scale model of the telescope.Once the mirrors reached 120 K (−153 °C; −244 °F),NIRCamtargeted the 7th-magnitude star HD 84406 inUrsa Major.[d]To do this, NIRCam took 1560 images of the sky and used these wide-ranging images to determine where in the sky each segment of the main mirror initially pointed.At first, the individual primary mirror segments were greatly misaligned, so the image contained 18 separate, blurry, images of the star field, each containing an image of the target star. The 18 images of HD 84406 are matched to their respective mirror segments, and the 18 segments are brought into approximate alignment centered on the star ("Segment Image Identification"). Each segment was then individually corrected of its major focusing errors, using a technique calledphase retrieval, resulting in 18 separate good quality images from the 18 mirror segments ("Segment Alignment"). The 18 images from each segment, were then moved so they precisely overlap to create a single image ("Image Stacking"). With the mirrors positioned for almost correct images, they had to be fine tuned to their operational accuracy of 50 nanometers, less than onewavelengthof the light that will be detected. A technique calleddispersed fringe sensingwas used to compare images from 20 pairings of mirrors, allowing most of the errors to be corrected ("Coarse Phasing"), and then introduced light defocus to each segment's image, allowing detection and correction of almost all remaining errors ("Fine Phasing"). These two processes were repeated three times, and Fine Phasing will be routinely checked throughout the telescope's operation. After three rounds of Coarse and Fine Phasing, the telescope was well aligned at one place in the NIRCam field of view. Measurements will be made at various points in the captured image, across all instruments, and corrections calculated from the detected variations in intensity, giving a well-aligned outcome across all instruments ("Telescope Alignment Over Instrument Fields of View"). Finally, a last round of Fine Phasing and checks of image quality on all instruments was performed, to ensure that any small residual errors remaining from the previous steps, were corrected ("Iterate Alignment for Final Correction"). The telescope's mirror segments were then aligned and able to capture precise focused images. In preparation for alignment, NASA announced at 19:28 UTC on 3 February 2022, that NIRCam had detected the telescope's firstphotons(although not yet complete images).On 11 February 2022, NASA announced the telescope had almost completed phase 1 of alignment, with every segment of its primary mirror having located and imaged the target star HD 84406, and all segments brought into approximate alignment.Phase 1 alignment was completed on 18 February 2022,and a week later, phases 2 and 3 were also completed.This meant the 18 segments were working in unison, however until all 7 phases are complete, the segments were still acting as 18 smaller telescopes rather than one larger one.At the same time as the primary mirror was being commissioned, hundreds of other instrument commissioning and calibration tasks were also ongoing. Webb observing time is allocated through a General Observers (GO) program, a Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) program, a Director's Discretionary Early Release Science (DD-ERS) program,a calibration program, and a Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) program.The GTO program provides guaranteed observing time for scientists who developed hardware and software components for the observatory. The GO program provides all astronomers the opportunity to apply for observing time and will represent the bulk of the observing time. GO programs are selected through peer review by a Time Allocation Committee (TAC), similar to the proposal review process used for the Hubble Space Telescope. The DDT program is used for time-critical observations. In November 2017, the Space Telescope Science Institute announced the selection of 13 Director's Discretionary Early Release Science (DD-ERS) programs, chosen through a competitive proposal process.The observations for these programs –Early Release Observations(ERO)– were to be obtained during the first five months of Webb science operations after the end of the commissioning period. A total of 460 hours of observing time was awarded to these 13 programs, which span science topics including theSolar System,exoplanets,starsandstar formation, nearby and distantgalaxies,gravitational lenses, andquasars. These 13 ERS programs were to use a total of 242.8 hours of observing time on the telescope (not including Webb observing overheads andslewtime). For GO Cycle 1 there were 6,000 hours of observation time available to allocate, and 1,173 proposals were submitted requesting a total of 24,500 hours of observation time.Selection of Cycle 1 GO programs was announced on 30 March 2021, with 266 programs approved. These included 13 large programs and treasury programs producing data for public access.The Cycle 2 GO program was announced on 10 May 2023.Webb science observations are nominally scheduled in weekly increments. The observation plan for every week is published on Mondays by the Space Telescope Science Institute.In Cycle 4 the telescope showed its continued popularity in the astronomy community by garnering 2,377 proposals for 78,000 hours of observing time, nine times more than the available amount. The JWST completed its commissioning and began full scientific operations on 11 July 2022.With some exceptions, most experiment data is kept private for one year for the exclusive use of scientists running that particular experiment, and then the raw data is released to the public. JWST observations substantially advanced understanding of exoplanets, the first billion years of the universe,and other astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. The first full-color images and spectroscopic data were released on 12 July 2022, which also marked the official beginning of Webb's general science operations. U.S. PresidentJoe Bidenrevealed the first image,Webb's First Deep Field, on 11 July 2022.Additional releases around this time include: On 14 July 2022, NASA presented images ofJupiterand related areas by the JWST, including infrared views. In a preprint released around the same time, NASA, ESA and CSA scientists stated that "the science performance of JWST is better than expected". The document stated that during the commissioning, the instruments captured spectra of transiting exoplanets with a precision better than 1000 ppm per data point, and tracked moving objects with speeds up to 67 milliarcseconds/second, more than twice as fast as the requirement.[a]It also obtained the spectra of hundreds of stars simultaneously in a dense field towards theMilky Way'sGalactic Center. Other targets included: Within two weeks of the first Webb images, several preprint papers described a wide range of high redshift and very luminous (presumably large) galaxies believed to date from 235 million years (z=16.7) to 280 million years after the Big Bang, far earlier than previously known.On 17 August 2022, NASA released a large mosaic image of 690 individual frames taken by the NIRCam on Webb of numerous very early galaxies.Some early galaxies observed by Webb likeCEERS-93316, which was believed to have an estimatedphotometric redshiftof approximately z=16.7 corresponding to 235.8 million years after the Big Bang, are high redshift galaxy candidates.However, for CEERS-93316 specifically, a laterspectroscopic redshiftmeasurement revealed a more accurate redshift value of approximately z=4.91.In September 2022,primordial black holeswere proposed as explaining these unexpectedly large and early galaxies.In May 2024, the JWST identified the most distant known galaxy,JADES-GS-z14-0,seen just 290 million years after the Big Bang, corresponding to a redshift of 14.32. Part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), this discovery highlights a galaxy significantly more luminous and massive than expected for such an early period. Detailed analysis using JWST's NIRSpec and MIRI instruments revealed this galaxy's remarkable properties, including its significant size and dust content, challenging current models of early galaxy formation.

TheSpace Shuttleis a retired, partiallyreusablelow Earth orbitalspacecraft systemoperated from 1981 to 2011 by the U.S.National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) as part of theSpace Shuttle program. Its official program name was theSpace Transportation System(STS), taken from the 1969 plan led by U.S. vice presidentSpiro Agnewfor a system of reusable spacecraft where it was the only item funded for development.: 163–166 The first (STS-1) of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights (STS-5) beginning in 1982. Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011. They launched from theKennedy Space Center(KSC) inFlorida. Operational missions launched numeroussatellites,interplanetary probes, and theHubble Space Telescope(HST), conducted science experiments in orbit, participated in theShuttle-Mirprogramwith Russia, and participated in the construction and servicing of theInternational Space Station(ISS). The Space Shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1,323 days. Space Shuttle components include theOrbiter Vehicle(OV) with three clusteredRocketdyneRS-25main engines, a pair of recoverablesolid rocket boosters(SRBs), and the expendableexternal tank(ET) containingliquid hydrogenandliquid oxygen. The Space Shuttle waslaunched vertically, like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the orbiter's threemain engines, which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, while the main engines continued to operate, and the ET was jettisoned after main engine cutoff and just beforeorbit insertion, which used the orbiter's twoOrbital Maneuvering System(OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit andreenter the atmosphere. The orbiter was protected during reentry by itsthermal protection systemtiles, and itglidedas aspaceplaneto a runway landing, usually to theShuttle Landing Facilityat KSC, Florida, or toRogers Dry LakeinEdwards Air Force Base, California. If the landing occurred at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC atop theShuttle Carrier Aircraft(SCA), a specially modifiedBoeing 747designed to carry the shuttle above it. The first orbiter,Enterprise, was built in 1976 and used inApproach and Landing Tests(ALT), but had no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built:Columbia,Challenger,Discovery, andAtlantis. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents:Challengerin 1986andColumbiain 2003, with a total of 14 astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter,Endeavour, was built in 1991 to replaceChallenger. The three surviving operational vehicles were retired from service followingAtlantis'sfinal flighton July 21, 2011. The U.S. relied on the RussianSoyuz spacecraftto transport astronauts to the ISS from the last Shuttle flight until the launch of theCrew Dragon Demo-2mission in May 2020. In the late 1930s, the German government launched the "Amerikabomber" (English: America bomber) project, andEugen Sänger's idea, together with mathematicianIrene Bredt, was a winged rocket called theSilbervogel(German for "silver bird").During the 1950s, theUnited States Air Forceproposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and air-to-ground weapons employment. In the late 1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusableX-20 Dyna-Soar. The Air Force collaborated withNASAon the Dyna-Soar and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization ofProject Geminiled to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for theaerospaceplane, a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962–1963.: 162–163 Beginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developinglifting bodiesto test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested theNASA M2-F1,Northrop M2-F2,Northrop M2-F3,Northrop HL-10,Martin Marietta X-24A, and theMartin Marietta X-24B. The program tested aerodynamic characteristics that would later be incorporated in design of the Space Shuttle, including unpowered landing from a high altitude and speed.: 142: 16–18 On September 24, 1966, as the Apollo space program neared its design completion, NASA and the Air Force released a joint study concluding that a new vehicle was required to satisfy their respective future demands and that a partially reusable system would be the most cost-effective solution.: 164The head of the NASA Office of Manned Space Flight,George Mueller, announced the plan for a reusable shuttle on August 10, 1968. NASA issued arequest for proposal(RFP) for designs of the Integral Launch and Reentry Vehicle (ILRV) on October 30, 1968.Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.: 19–22 In December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts toGeneral Dynamics,Lockheed,McDonnell Douglas, andNorth American Rockwell. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support short-duration crewed missions and space station, as well as the capabilities to launch, service, and retrieve satellites. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under the leadership of U.S. vice presidentSpiro Agnew, issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as aspace tugfor transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusablenuclear upper stagefor deep space travel.: 163–166 After the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs.Max Faget, a NASA engineer who had worked to design theMercurycapsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.The Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory argued that a straight-wing design would not be able to withstand the high thermal and aerodynamic stresses during reentry, and would not provide the required cross-range capability. Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.: 166 After they established the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force determined the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting 29,000 kg (65,000 lb) to an eastward LEO or 18,000 kg (40,000 lb) into apolar orbit. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a 4.6 by 18 m (15 by 60 ft) payload bay. NASA evaluated theF-1andJ-2engines from theSaturn rockets, and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract toRocketdyneto begin development on theRS-25engine.: 165–170 NASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.: 167NASA and the Air Force elected to usesolid-propellant boostersbecause of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, PresidentRichard Nixonapproved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. The development of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) remained the responsibility of Rocketdyne, and the contract was issued in July 1971, and updated SSME specifications were submitted to Rocketdyne that April.The following August, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, which had by then constructed a full-scale mock-up, later namedInspiration.In August 1973, NASA awarded the external tank contract toMartin Marietta, and in November the solid-rocket booster contract toMorton Thiokol.: 170–173 On June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first orbiter, OV-101, dubbed Constitution, later to be renamedEnterprise.Enterprisewas designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, andEnterprisewas moved to theEdwards Air Force Baseto begin testing.: 173Rockwell constructed theMain Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at theNational Space Technology Laboratory(NSTL) to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.: II-163Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.: I-415 The beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months whilePratt & Whitneychallenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttleable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.: 174–175 NASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle'sthermal protection system. Previous NASA spacecraft had usedablativeheat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweightaluminum, and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began onColumbiaon March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.: 175–177At the time of its arrival at the KSC,Columbiastill had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation beforeColumbiacould fly.: 46–48 On January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later namedChallenger. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were namedDiscoveryandAtlantis. Construction of OV-105, later namedEndeavour, began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After theloss ofChallenger, NASA resumed production ofEndeavourin September 1987.: 52–53 After it arrived at Edwards AFB,Enterpriseunderwent flight testing with theShuttle Carrier Aircraft, a Boeing 747 that had been modified to carry the orbiter. In February 1977,Enterprisebegan theApproach and Landing Tests(ALT) and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977,Enterpriseconducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.: 173–174After four additional flights,Enterprisewas moved to theMarshall Space Flight Center(MSFC) on March 13, 1978.Enterpriseunderwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979,Enterprisewas taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved toLC-39. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of the launch complex hardware.Enterprisewas taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of theSLC-6atVandenberg AFBin 1984.: 40–41 On November 24, 1980,Columbiawas mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29.: III-22The first Space Shuttle mission,STS-1, would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft.: III-24On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted byJohn YoungandRobert Crippen. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of theColumbia.: 277–278NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside ofColumbia, and determined there was no damage.: 335–337Columbiareentered the atmosphere and landed at Edwards AFB on April 14.: III-24 NASA conducted three additional test flights withColumbiain 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982,STS-4, flown byKen MattinglyandHenry Hartsfield, landed on a concrete runway at Edwards AFB. PresidentRonald Reaganand his wifeNancymet the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared its Space Transportation System (STS) operational.: 178–179 The Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed forreuse. Each Space Shuttle orbiter was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or ten years of operational life, although this was later extended.: 11At launch, it consisted of theorbiter, which contained thecrewand payload, theexternal tank(ET), and the twosolid rocket boosters(SRBs).: 363 Responsibility for the Space Shuttle components was spread among multiple NASA field centers. The KSC was responsible for launch, landing, and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program). The U.S. Air Force at theVandenberg Air Force Basewas responsible for launch, landing, and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used). TheJohnson Space Center(JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations and the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters. TheJohn C. Stennis Space Centerhandled main engine testing, and theGoddard Space Flight Centermanaged the global tracking network. The orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.: 365Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-delta wingswere 18 m (60 ft) long, and were swept 81° at the inner leading edge and 45° at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboardelevonto provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to controlpitch. The orbiter'svertical stabilizerwas swept backwards at 45° and contained arudderthat could split to act as aspeed brake.: 382–389The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-partdrag parachutesystem to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter usedretractable landing gearwith a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.: 408–411 The Space Shuttle crew varied per mission. They underwent rigorous testing and training to meet thequalification requirementsfor their roles. The crew was divided into three categories: Pilots, Mission Specialists, and Payload Specialists. Pilots were further divided into two roles: the Space Shuttle Commander, who would seat in the forward left seat and the Space Shuttle Pilot who would seat in the forward right seat.The test flights, STS-1 through STS-4 only had two members each, the commander and pilot. The commander and the pilot were both qualified to fly and land the orbiter. The on-orbit operations, such as experiments, payload deployment, and EVAs, were conducted primarily by the mission specialists who were specifically trained for their intended missions and systems. Early in the Space Shuttle program, NASA flew with payload specialists, who were typically systems specialists who worked for the company paying for the payload's deployment or operations. The final payload specialist,Gregory B. Jarvis, flew onSTS-51-L, and future non-pilots were designated as mission specialists. An astronaut flew as a crewed spaceflight engineer on bothSTS-51-CandSTS-51-Jto serve as a military representative for aNational Reconnaissance Officepayload. A Space Shuttle crew typically had seven astronauts, withSTS-61-Aflying with eight.: III-21 The crew compartment comprised three decks and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The flight deck consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck was located below the flight deck and was where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on anextravehicular activity(EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.: 60–62: 365–369 On the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight,STS-5, until the loss ofChallenger, the crew wore one-piece light bluenomexflight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After theChallengerdisaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressureAdvanced Crew Escape Suit(ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation.Columbiaoriginally had modifiedSR-71zero-zero ejection seatsinstalled for theALTand first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed afterSTS-9.: 370–371 The flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with aheads-up display(HUD) and aRotational Hand Controller(RHC) togimbalthe engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also hadruddercontrols, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground.: 369–372The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the MultifunctionCRTDisplay System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998,Atlantiswas upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was aglass cockpitupgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 onSTS-101, and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight deck contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control theRemote Manipulator Systemduring cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for aclosed-circuit televisionto view the cargo bay.: 372–376 The mid-deck contained the crew equipment storage, sleeping area, galley, medical equipment, and hygiene stations for the crew. The crew used modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on their needs, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that the crew used for entry and exit while on Earth.: II–26–33 Theairlockis a structure installed to allow movement between two spaces with different gas components, conditions, or pressures. Continuing on the mid-deck structure, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was installed as an external airlock in the payload bay onDiscovery,Atlantis, andEndeavourto improve docking withMirand theISS, along with theOrbiter Docking System.: II–26–33The airlock module can be fitted in the mid-bay, or connected to it but in the payload bay.: 81With an internal cylindrical volume of 1.60 metres (5 feet 3 inches) diameter and 2.11 metres (6 feet 11 inches) in length, it can hold two suited astronauts. It has two D-shaped hatchways 1.02 m (40 in) long (diameter), and 0.91 m (36 in) wide.: 82 The orbiter was equipped with anavionicssystem to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained threemicrowave scanning beam landing systems, threegyroscopes, threeTACANs, threeaccelerometers, tworadar altimeters, twobarometric altimeters, threeattitude indicators, twoMach indicators, and twoMode Ctransponders. During reentry, the crew deployed twoair data probesonce they were traveling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had threeinertial measuring units(IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains twostar trackersto align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with aninertial navigation system(INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew aGPSreceiver for the first time aboardSTS-51. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew onSTS-118in August 2007.: 402–403 While in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of fourS bandradios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios werephase modulationtransceivers, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios werefrequency modulationtransmittersand were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within theirline of sight, NASA used theTracking and Data Relay Satellite Systemand theSpacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Networkground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidthKubandradio out of the cargo bay, which could also be utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with twoUHFradios for communications withair traffic controland astronauts conducting EVA.: 403–404 The Space Shuttle'sfly-by-wirecontrol system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general-purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitor the Space Shuttle components.: 232–233The original GPC used was the IBMAP-101B, which used a separatecentral processing unit(CPU) and input/output processor (IOP), andnon-volatilesolid-state memory. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvering, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.: 405–408The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle's computers to be reset at the year change. In 2007, NASA engineers devised a solution so Space Shuttle flights could cross the year-end boundary. Space Shuttle missions typically brought a portable general support computer (PGSC) that could integrate with the orbiter vehicle's computers and communication suite, as well as monitor scientific and payload data. Early missions brought theGrid Compass, one of the first laptop computers, as the PGSC, but later missions broughtAppleandIntellaptops.: 408 The payload bay comprised most of the orbiter vehicle'sfuselage, and provided the cargo-carrying space for the Space Shuttle's payloads. It was 18 m (60 ft) long and 4.6 m (15 ft) wide, and could accommodate cylindrical payloads up to 4.6 m (15 ft) in diameter. Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry. Payloads were secured in the payload bay to the attachment points on thelongerons. The payload bay doors served an additional function as radiators for the orbiter vehicle's heat, and were opened upon reaching orbit for heat rejection.: 62–64 The orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-on components depending on the mission. This included orbital laboratories,: II-304, 319boosters for launching payloads farther into space,: II-326the Remote Manipulator System (RMS),: II-40and optionally the EDO pallet to extend the mission duration.: II-86To limit the fuel consumption while the orbiter was docked at the ISS, theStation-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System(SSPTS) was developed to convert and transfer station power to the orbiter.: II-87–88The SSPTS was first used on STS-118, and was installed onDiscoveryandEndeavour.: III-366–368 The Remote Manipulator System (RMS), also known as Canadarm, was a mechanical arm attached to the cargo bay. It could be used to grasp and manipulate payloads, as well as serve as a mobile platform for astronauts conducting an EVA. The RMS was built by the Canadian companySpar Aerospaceand was controlled by an astronaut inside the orbiter's flight deck using their windows and closed-circuit television. The RMS allowed for six degrees of freedom and had six joints located at three points along the arm. The original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to 29,000 kg (65,000 lb), which was later improved to 270,000 kg (586,000 lb).: 384–385 The Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientific research while in orbit. The Spacelab module contained two 2.7 m (9 ft) segments that were mounted in the aft end of the payload bay to maintain the center of gravity during flight. Astronauts entered the Spacelab module through a 2.7 or 5.8 m (8.72 or 18.88 ft) tunnel that connected to the airlock. The Spacelab equipment was primarily stored in pallets, which provided storage for both experiments as well as computer and power equipment.: 434–435Spacelab hardware was flown on 28 missions through 1999 and studied subjects including astronomy, microgravity, radar, and life sciences. Spacelab hardware also supported missions such as Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing and space station resupply. The Spacelab module was tested on STS-2 and STS-3, and the first full mission was on STS-9. Three RS-25 engines, also known as the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), were mounted on the orbiter's aft fuselage in a triangular pattern. The engine nozzles could gimbal ±10.5° in pitch, and ±8.5° inyawduring ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. Thetitanium alloyreusable engines were independent of the orbiter vehicle and would be removed and replaced in between flights. The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid-fueled rocket. The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of 226.5 bar (3,285 psi). The engine nozzle is 287 cm (113 in) tall and has an interior diameter of 229 cm (90.3 in). The nozzle is cooled by 1,080 interior lines carrying liquid hydrogen and is thermally protected by insulative and ablative material.: II–177–183 The RS-25 engines had several improvements to enhance reliability and power. During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the originally specified thrust at 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001, which reduced the chamber pressure to 207.5 bars (3,010 psi), as it had a largerthroatarea. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106% or 109% used for mission aborts.: 106–107 The Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) consisted of two aft-mountedAJ10-190engines and the associated propellant tanks. The AJ10 engines usedmonomethylhydrazine(MMH) oxidized bydinitrogen tetroxide(N2O4). The pods carried a maximum of 2,140 kg (4,718 lb) of MMH and 3,526 kg (7,773 lb) of N2O4. The OMS engines were used after main engine cut-off (MECO) for orbital insertion. Throughout the flight, they were used for orbit changes, as well as the deorbit burn prior to reentry. Each OMS engine produced 27,080 N (6,087 lbf) of thrust, and the entire system could provide 305 m/s (1,000 ft/s) ofvelocity change.: II–80 The orbiter was protected from heat during reentry by the thermal protection system (TPS), athermal soakingprotective layer around the orbiter. In contrast with previous US spacecraft, which had used ablative heat shields, the reusability of the orbiter required a multi-use heat shield.: 72–73During reentry, the TPS experienced temperatures up to 1,600 °C (3,000 °F), but had to keep the orbiter vehicle's aluminum skin temperature below 180 °C (350 °F). The TPS primarily consisted of four types of tiles. The nose cone and leading edges of the wings experienced temperatures above 1,300 °C (2,300 °F), and were protected by reinforced carbon-carbon tiles (RCC). Thicker RCC tiles were developed and installed in 1998 to prevent damage frommicrometeoroid and orbital debris, and were further improved after RCC damage caused in theColumbiadisaster. Beginning withSTS-114, the orbiter vehicles were equipped with the wing leading edge impact detection system to alert the crew to any potential damage.: II–112–113The entire underside of the orbiter vehicle, as well as the other hottest surfaces, were protected with tiles of high-temperature reusable surface insulation, made ofborosilicate glass-coatedsilicafibers that trapped heat in air pockets and redirected it out. Areas on the upper parts of the orbiter vehicle were coated in tiles of white low-temperature reusable surface insulation with similar composition, which provided protection for temperatures below 650 °C (1,200 °F). The payload bay doors and parts of the upper wing surfaces were coated in reusableNomexfelt surface insulation or inbeta cloth, as the temperature there remained below 370 °C (700 °F).: 395 The Space Shuttle external tank (ET) carried the propellant for the Space Shuttle Main Engines, and connected the orbiter vehicle with the solid rocket boosters. The ET was 47 m (153.8 ft) tall and 8.4 m (27.6 ft) in diameter, and contained separate tanks for liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The liquid oxygen tank was housed in the nose of the ET, and was 15 m (49.3 ft) tall. The liquid hydrogen tank comprised the bulk of the ET, and was 29 m (96.7 ft) tall. The orbiter vehicle was attached to the ET at two umbilical plates, which contained five propellant and two electrical umbilicals, and forward and aft structural attachments. The exterior of the ET was covered in orange spray-on foam to allow it to survive the heat of ascent.: 421–422 The ET provided propellant to the Space Shuttle Main Engines from liftoff until main engine cutoff. The ET separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff and could be triggered automatically or manually. At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracted its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords were sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle. After the bolts attached at the structural attachments were sheared, the ET separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the ET to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The ET was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.: 422 For the first two missions, STS-1 andSTS-2, the ET was covered in 270 kg (595 lb) of white fire-retardant latex paint to provide protection against damage from ultraviolet radiation. Further research determined that the orange foam itself was sufficiently protected, and the ET was no longer covered in latex paint beginning on STS-3.: II-210A light-weight tank (LWT) was first flown on STS-6, which reduced tank weight by 4,700 kg (10,300 lb). The LWT's weight was reduced by removing components from the hydrogen tank and reducing the thickness of some skin panels.: 422In 1998, a super light-weight ET (SLWT) first flew onSTS-91. The SLWT used the 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy, which was 40% stronger and 10% less dense than its predecessor, 2219 aluminum-lithium alloy. The SLWT weighed 3,400 kg (7,500 lb) less than the LWT, which allowed the Space Shuttle to deliver heavy elements to ISS's high inclination orbit.: 423–424 The Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) provided 71.4% of the Space Shuttle's thrust during liftoff and ascent, and were the largestsolid-propellant motorsever flown.Each SRB was 45 m (149.2 ft) tall and 3.7 m (12.2 ft) wide, weighed 68,000 kg (150,000 lb), and had a steel exterior approximately 13 mm (.5 in) thick. The SRB's subcomponents were the solid-propellant motor, nose cone, and rocket nozzle. The solid-propellant motor comprised the majority of the SRB's structure. Its casing consisted of 11 steel sections which made up its four main segments. The nose cone housed the forward separation motors and the parachute systems that were used during recovery. The rocket nozzles could gimbal up to 8° to allow for in-flight adjustments.: 425–429 The rocket motors were each filled with a total 500,000 kg (1,106,640 lb) of solid rocket propellant (APCP+PBAN), and joined in theVehicle Assembly Building(VAB) at KSC.: 425–426In addition to providing thrust during the first stage of launch, the SRBs provided structural support for the orbiter vehicle and ET, as they were the only system that was connected to themobile launcher platform(MLP).: 427At the time of launch, the SRBs were armed at T−5 minutes, and could only be electrically ignited once the RS-25 engines had ignited and were without issue.: 428They each provided 12,500 kN (2,800,000 lbf) of thrust, which was later improved to 13,300 kN (3,000,000 lbf) beginning onSTS-8.: 425After expending their fuel, the SRBs werejettisonedapproximately two minutes after launch at an altitude of approximately 46 km (150,000 ft). Following separation, they deployed drogue and main parachutes, landed in the ocean, and were recovered by the crews aboard the shipsMVFreedom StarandMVLiberty Star.: 430Once they were returned to Cape Canaveral, they were cleaned and disassembled. The rocket motor, igniter, and nozzle were then shipped to Thiokol to be refurbished and reused on subsequent flights.: 124 The SRBs underwent several redesigns throughout the program's lifetime.STS-6andSTS-7used SRBs 2,300 kg (5,000 lb) lighter due to walls that were 0.10 mm (.004 in) thinner, but were determined to be too thin to fly safely. Subsequent flights untilSTS-26used cases that were 0.076 mm (.003 in) thinner than the standard-weight cases, which reduced 1,800 kg (4,000 lb). After theChallengerdisaster as a result of anO-ringfailing at low temperature, the SRBs were redesigned to provide a constant seal regardless of the ambient temperature.: 425–426 The Space Shuttle's operations were supported by vehicles and infrastructure that facilitated its transportation, construction, and crew access. Thecrawler-transporterscarried the MLP and the Space Shuttle from the VAB to the launch site.TheShuttle Carrier Aircraft(SCA) were two modifiedBoeing 747sthat could carry an orbiter on its back. The original SCA (N905NA) was first flown in 1975, and was used for theALTand ferrying the orbiter from Edwards AFB to the KSC on all missions prior to 1991. A second SCA (N911NA) was acquired in 1988, and was first used to transportEndeavourfrom the factory to the KSC. Following the retirement of the Space Shuttle, N905NA was put on display at the JSC, and N911NA was put on display at theJoe Davies Heritage AirparkinPalmdale, California.: I–377–391TheCrew Transport Vehicle(CTV) was a modified airportjet bridgethat was used to assist astronauts to egress from the orbiter after landing, where they would undergo their post-mission medical checkups.TheAstrovantransported astronauts from the crew quarters in the Operations and Checkout Building to the launch pad on launch day.TheNASA Railroadcomprised three locomotives that transported SRB segments from theFlorida East Coast RailwayinTitusvilleto the KSC. The Space Shuttle was prepared for launch primarily in the VAB at the KSC. The SRBs were assembled and attached to the external tank on the MLP. The orbiter vehicle was prepared at theOrbiter Processing Facility(OPF) and transferred to the VAB, where a crane was used to rotate it to the vertical orientation and mate it to the external tank.: 132–133Once the entire stack was assembled, the MLP was carried for 5.6 km (3.5 mi) toLaunch Complex 39by one of thecrawler-transporters.: 137After the Space Shuttle arrived at one of the two launchpads, it would connect to the Fixed and Rotation Service Structures, which provided servicing capabilities, payload insertion, and crew transportation.: 139–141The crew was transported to the launch pad at T−3 hours and entered the orbiter vehicle, which was closed at T−2 hours.: III–8Liquid oxygen and hydrogen were loaded into the external tank via umbilicals that attached to the orbiter vehicle, which began at T−5 hours 35 minutes. At T−3 hours 45 minutes, the hydrogen fast-fill was complete, followed 15 minutes later by the oxygen tank fill. Both tanks were slowly filled up until the launch as the oxygen and hydrogen evaporated.: II–186 Thelaunch commit criteriaconsidered precipitation, temperatures, cloud cover, lightning forecast, wind, and humidity.The Space Shuttle was not launched under conditions where it could have been struck bylightning, as its exhaust plume could have triggered lightning by providing a current path to ground after launch, which occurred onApollo 12.: 239The NASA Anvil Rule for a Shuttle launch stated that ananvil cloudcould not appear within a distance of 19km(10 nmi).The Shuttle Launch Weather Officer monitored conditions until the final decision to scrub a launch was announced. In addition to the weather at the launch site, conditions had to be acceptable at one of theTransatlantic Abort Landing sitesand the SRB recovery area. The mission crew and the Launch Control Center (LCC) personnel completed systems checks throughout the countdown. Two built-in holds at T−20 minutes and T−9 minutes provided scheduled breaks to address any issues and additional preparation.: III–8After the built-in hold at T−9 minutes, the countdown was automatically controlled by the Ground Launch Sequencer (GLS) at the LCC, which stopped the countdown if it sensed a critical problem with any of the Space Shuttle's onboard systems.At T−3 minutes 45 seconds, the engines began conducting gimbal tests, which were concluded at T−2 minutes 15 seconds. The groundLaunch Processing Systemhanded off the control to the orbiter vehicle's GPCs at T−31 seconds. At T−16 seconds, the GPCs armed the SRBs, the sound suppression system (SPS) began to drench the MLP and SRB trenches with 1,100,000 L (300,000 U.S. gal) of water to protect the orbiter vehicle from damage byacousticalenergy and rocket exhaust reflected from the flame trench and MLP during lift-off.At T−10 seconds, hydrogen igniters were activated under each engine bell to quell the stagnant gas inside the cones before ignition. Failure to burn these gases could trip the onboard sensors and create the possibility of an overpressure and explosion of the vehicle during the firing phase. The hydrogen tank's prevalves were opened at T−9.5 seconds in preparation for engine start.: II–186 Beginning at T−6.6 seconds, the main engines were ignited sequentially at 120-millisecond intervals. All three RS-25 engines were required to reach 90% rated thrust by T−3 seconds, otherwise the GPCs would initiate anRSLS abort. If all three engines indicated nominal performance by T−3 seconds, they were commanded to gimbal to liftoff configuration and the command would be issued to arm the SRBs for ignition at T−0.Between T−6.6 seconds and T−3 seconds, while the RS-25 engines were firing but the SRBs were still bolted to the pad, the offset thrust would cause the Space Shuttle to pitch down 650 mm (25.5 in) measured at the tip of the external tank; the 3-second delay allowed the stack to return to nearly vertical before SRB ignition. This movement was nicknamed the "twang." At T−0, the eightfrangible nutsholding the SRBs to the pad were detonated, the final umbilicals were disconnected, the SSMEs were commanded to 100% throttle, and the SRBs were ignited.By T+0.23 seconds, the SRBs built up enough thrust for liftoff to commence, and reached maximum chamber pressure by T+0.6 seconds.: II–186At T−0, the JSCMission Control Centerassumed control of the flight from the LCC.: III–9 At T+4 seconds, when the Space Shuttle reached an altitude of 22 meters (73 ft), the RS-25 engines were throttled up to 104.5%. At approximately T+7 seconds, the Space Shuttle rolled to a heads-down orientation at an altitude of 110 meters (350 ft), which reduced aerodynamic stress and provided an improved communication and navigation orientation. Approximately 20–30 seconds into ascent and an altitude of 2,700 meters (9,000 ft), the RS-25 engines were throttled down to 65–72% to reduce the maximum aerodynamic forces atMax Q.: III–8–9Additionally, the shape of the SRB propellant was designed to cause thrust to decrease at the time of Max Q.: 427The GPCs could dynamically control the throttle of the RS-25 engines based upon the performance of the SRBs.: II–187 At approximately T+123 seconds and an altitude of 46,000 meters (150,000 ft), pyrotechnic fasteners released the SRBs, which reached anapogeeof 67,000 meters (220,000 ft) before parachuting into theAtlantic Ocean. The Space Shuttle continued its ascent using only the RS-25 engines. On earlier missions, the Space Shuttle remained in the heads-down orientation to maintain communications with thetracking stationinBermuda, but later missions, beginning withSTS-87, rolled to a heads-up orientation at T+6 minutes for communication with thetracking and data relay satelliteconstellation. The RS-25 engines were throttled at T+7 minutes 30 seconds to limit vehicle acceleration to 3g. At 6 seconds prior to main engine cutoff (MECO), which occurred at T+8 minutes 30 seconds, the RS-25 engines were throttled down to 67%. The GPCs controlled ET separation and dumped the remaining liquid oxygen and hydrogen to prevent outgassing while in orbit. The ET continued on a ballistic trajectory and broke up during reentry, with some small pieces landing in the Indian or Pacific Ocean.: III–9–10 Early missions used two firings of the OMS to achieve orbit; the first firing raised the apogee while the second circularized the orbit. Missions afterSTS-38used the RS-25 engines to achieve the optimal apogee, and used the OMS engines to circularize the orbit. The orbital altitude and inclination were mission-dependent, and the Space Shuttle's orbits varied from 220 to 620 km (120 to 335 nmi).: III–10 The type of mission the Space Shuttle was assigned dictated the type of orbit that it entered. The initial design of the reusable Space Shuttle envisioned an increasingly cheap launch platform to deploy commercial and government satellites. Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter. Following theChallengerdisaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as theDelta II.: III–108, 123While later missions still launched commercial payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely directed towards scientific payloads, such as theHubble Space Telescope,: III–148Spacelab,: 434–435and theGalileo spacecraft.: III–140Beginning withSTS-71, the orbiter vehicle conducted dockings with theMir space station.: III–224In its final decade of operation, the Space Shuttle was used for the construction of theInternational Space Station.: III–264Most missions involved staying in orbit several days to two weeks, although longer missions were possible with theExtended Duration Orbiterpallet.: III–86The 17 day 15 hourSTS-80mission was the longest Space Shuttle mission duration.: III–238 Approximately four hours prior to deorbit, the crew began preparing the orbiter vehicle for reentry by closing the payload doors, radiating excess heat, and retracting the Ku band antenna. The orbiter vehicle maneuvered to an upside-down, tail-first orientation and began a 2–4 minute OMS burn approximately 20 minutes before it reentered the atmosphere. The orbiter vehicle reoriented itself to a nose-forward position with a 40° angle-of-attack, and the forwardreaction control system(RCS) jets were emptied of fuel and disabled prior to reentry. The orbiter vehicle's reentry was defined as starting at an altitude of 120 km (400,000 ft), when it was traveling at approximately Mach 25. The orbiter vehicle's reentry was controlled by the GPCs, which followed a preset angle-of-attack plan to prevent unsafe heating of the TPS. During reentry, the orbiter's speed was regulated by altering the amount of drag produced, which was controlled by means of angle of attack, as well as bank angle. The latter could be used to control drag without changing the angle of attack. A series of roll reversals[c]were performed to control azimuth while banking.The orbiter vehicle's aft RCS jets were disabled as its ailerons, elevators, and rudder became effective in the lower atmosphere. At an altitude of 46 km (150,000 ft), the orbiter vehicle opened itsspeed brakeon the vertical stabilizer. At 8 minutes 44 seconds prior to landing, the crew deployed the air data probes, and began lowering the angle-of-attack to 36°.: III–12The orbiter's maximumglide ratio/lift-to-drag ratiovaried considerably with speed, ranging from 1.3 athypersonicspeeds to 4.9 at subsonic speeds.: II–1The orbiter vehicle flew to one of the two Heading Alignment Cones, located 48 km (30 mi) away from each end of the runway's centerline, where it made its final turns to dissipate excess energy prior to its approach and landing. Once the orbiter vehicle was traveling subsonically, the crew took over manual control of the flight.: III–13 The approach and landing phase began when the orbiter vehicle was at an altitude of 3,000 m (10,000 ft) and traveling at 150 m/s (300 kn). The orbiter followed either a -20° or -18° glideslope and descended at approximately 51 m/s (167 ft/s). The speed brake was used to keep a continuous speed, and crew initiated a pre-flare maneuver to a -1.5° glideslope at an altitude of 610 m (2,000 ft). The landing gear was deployed 10 seconds prior to touchdown, when the orbiter was at an altitude of 91 m (300 ft) and traveling 150 m/s (288 kn). A final flare maneuver reduced the orbiter vehicle's descent rate to 0.9 m/s (3 ft/s), with touchdown occurring at 100–150 m/s (195–295 kn), depending on the weight of the orbiter vehicle. After the landing gear touched down, the crew deployed a drag chute out of the vertical stabilizer, and began wheel braking when the orbiter was traveling slower than 72 m/s (140 kn). After the orbiter's wheels stopped, the crew deactivated the flight components and prepared to exit.: III–13 The primary Space Shuttle landing site was theShuttle Landing Facilityat KSC, where 78 of the 133 successful landings occurred. In the event of unfavorable landing conditions, the Shuttle could delay its landing or land at an alternate location. The primary alternate was Edwards AFB, which was used for 54 landings.: III–18–20STS-3landed at theWhite Sands Space HarborinNew Mexicoand required extensive post-processing after exposure to thegypsum-rich sand, some of which was found inColumbiadebris afterSTS-107.: III–28Landings at alternate airfields required the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft to transport the orbiter back toCape Canaveral.: III–13 In addition to the pre-planned landing airfields, there were 85 agreed-uponemergency landing sitesto be used in different abort scenarios, with 58 located in other countries. The landing locations were chosen based upon political relationships, favorable weather, a runway at least 2,300 m (7,500 ft) long, andTACANorDMEequipment. Additionally, as the orbiter vehicle only had UHF radios, international sites with only VHF radios would have been unable to communicate directly with the crew. Facilities on the east coast of the US were planned for East Coast Abort Landings, while several sites in Europe and Africa were planned in the event of a Transoceanic Abort Landing. The facilities were prepared with equipment and personnel in the event of an emergency shuttle landing but were never used.: III–19 After the landing, ground crews approached the orbiter to conduct safety checks. Teams wearing self-contained breathing gear tested for the presence ofhydrogen,hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine,nitrogen tetroxide, andammoniato ensure the landing area was safe.Air conditioning and Freon lines were connected to cool the crew and equipment and dissipate excess heat from reentry.: III-13Aflight surgeonboarded the orbiter and performed medical checks of the crew before they disembarked. 
Once the orbiter was secured, it was towed to the OPF to be inspected, repaired, and prepared for the next mission.The processing included: The Space Shuttle flew from April 12, 1981,: III–24until July 21, 2011.: III–398Throughout the program, the Space Shuttle had 135 missions,: III–398of which 133 returned safely.: III–80, 304Throughout its lifetime, the Space Shuttle was used to conduct scientific research,: III–188deploy commercial,: III–66military,: III–68and scientific payloads,: III–148and was involved in the construction and operation ofMir: III–216and the ISS.: III–264During its tenure, the Space Shuttle served as the only U.S. vehicle to launch astronauts, of which there was no replacement until the launch ofCrew Dragon Demo-2on May 30, 2020. The overall NASA budget of the Space Shuttle program has been estimated to be $221 billion (in 2012 dollars).: III−488The developers of the Space Shuttle advocated for reusability as a cost-saving measure, which resulted in higher development costs for presumed lower costs-per-launch. During the design of the Space Shuttle, the Phase B proposals were not as cheap as the initial Phase A estimates indicated; Space Shuttle program manager Robert Thompson acknowledged that reducing cost-per-pound was not the primary objective of the further design phases, as other technical requirements could not be met with the reduced costs.: III−489−490Development estimates made in 1972 projected a per-pound cost of payload as low as $1,109 (in 2012) per pound, but the actual payload costs, not to include the costs for the research and development of the Space Shuttle, were $37,207 (in 2012) per pound.: III−491Per-launch costs varied throughout the program and were dependent on the rate of flights as well as research, development, and investigation proceedings throughout the Space Shuttle program. In 1982, NASA published an estimate of $260 million (in 2012) per flight, which was based on the prediction of 24 flights per year for a decade. The per-launch cost from 1995 to 2002, when the orbiters and ISS were not being constructed and there was no recovery work following a loss of crew, was $806 million. NASA published a study in 1999 that concluded that costs were $576 million (in 2012) if there were seven launches per year. In 2009, NASA determined that the cost of adding a single launch per year was $252 million (in 2012), which indicated that much of the Space Shuttle program costs are for year-round personnel and operations that continued regardless of the launch rate. Accounting for the entire Space Shuttle program budget, the per-launch cost was $1.642 billion (in 2012).: III−490 On January 28, 1986,STS-51-Ldisintegrated 73 seconds after launch, due to the failure of the right SRB, killing all seven astronauts on boardChallenger. The disaster was caused by the low-temperature impairment of an O-ring, a mission-critical seal used between segments of the SRB casing. Failure of the O-ring allowed hot combustion gases to escape from between the booster sections and burn through the adjacent ET, leading to a sequence of catastrophic events which caused the orbiter to disintegrate.: 71Repeated warnings from design engineers voicing concerns about the lack of evidence of the O-rings' safety when the temperature was below 53 °F (12 °C) had been ignored by NASA managers.: 148 On February 1, 2003,Columbiadisintegrated during re-entry, killing all seven of theSTS-107crew, because of damage to thecarbon-carbonleading edge of the wing caused during launch. Ground control engineers had made three separate requests for high-resolution images taken by the Department of Defense that would have provided an understanding of the extent of the damage, while NASA's chief TPS engineer requested that astronauts on boardColumbiabe allowed to leave the vehicle to inspect the damage. NASA managers intervened to stop the Department of Defense's imaging of the orbiter and refused the request for the spacewalk,: III–323and thus the feasibility of scenarios for astronaut repair or rescue byAtlantiswere not considered by NASA management at the time. The partial reusability of the Space Shuttle was one of the primary design requirements during its initial development.: 164The technical decisions that dictated the orbiter's return and re-use reduced the per-launch payload capabilities. The original intention was to compensate for this lower payload by lowering the per-launch costs and a high launch frequency. However, the actual costs of a Space Shuttle launch were higher than initially predicted, and the Space Shuttle did not fly the intended 24 missions per year as initially predicted by NASA.: III–489–490 The Space Shuttle was originally intended as a launch vehicle to deploy satellites, which it was primarily used for on the missions prior to theChallengerdisaster. NASA's pricing, which was below cost, was lower than expendable launch vehicles; the intention was that the high volume of Space Shuttle missions would compensate for early financial losses. The improvement of expendable launch vehicles and the transition away from commercial payloads on the Space Shuttle resulted in expendable launch vehicles becoming the primary deployment option for satellites.: III–109–112A key customer for the Space Shuttle was theNational Reconnaissance Office(NRO) responsible for spy satellites. The existence of NRO's connection was classified through 1993, and secret considerations of NRO payload requirements led to lack of transparency in the program. The proposedShuttle-Centaurprogram, cancelled in the wake of theChallengerdisaster, would have pushed the spacecraft beyond its operational capacity. The fatalChallengerandColumbiadisasters demonstrated the safety risks of the Space Shuttle that could result in the loss of the crew. The spaceplane design of the orbiter limited the abort options, as the abort scenarios required the controlled flight of the orbiter to a runway or to allow the crew to egress individually, rather than the abort escape options on theApolloandSoyuzspace capsules.Early safety analyses advertised by NASA engineers and management predicted the chance of a catastrophic failure resulting in the death of the crew as ranging from 1 in 100 launches to as rare as 1 in 100,000.Following the loss of two Space Shuttle missions, the risks for the initial missions were reevaluated, and the chance of a catastrophic loss of the vehicle and crew was found to be as high as 1 in 9.NASA management was criticized afterwards for accepting increased risk to the crew in exchange for higher mission rates. Both theChallengerandColumbiareports explained that NASA culture had failed to keep the crew safe by not objectively evaluating the potential risks of the missions.: 195–203 The Space Shuttle retirement was announced in January 2004.: III-347PresidentGeorge W. Bushannounced hisVision for Space Exploration, which called for the retirement of the Space Shuttle once it completed construction of the ISS.To ensure the ISS was properly assembled, the contributing partners determined the need for 16 remaining assembly missions in March 2006.: III-349One additional Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission was approved in October 2006.: III-352Originally,STS-134was to be the final Space Shuttle mission. However, theColumbiadisaster resulted in additional orbiters being prepared forlaunch on needin the event of a rescue mission. AsAtlantiswas prepared for the final launch-on-need mission, the decision was made in September 2010 that it would fly asSTS-135with a four-person crew that could remain at the ISS in the event of an emergency.: III-355STS-135 launched on July 8, 2011, and landed at the KSC on July 21, 2011, at 5:57 a.m. EDT (09:57 UTC).: III-398From then until the launch ofCrew DragonDemo-2 on May 30, 2020, the US launched its astronauts aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Following each orbiter's final flight, it was processed to make it safe for display.

TheArtemis programis aMoon explorationprogram led by the United States'National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA), formally established in 2017 viaSpace Policy Directive 1. The program is intended to reestablish a human presence on the Moon for the first time since theApollo 17mission in 1972, with a stated long-term goal to establish apermanent base on the Moonand facilitatehuman missions to Mars. Two principal elements of the Artemis program are derived from the now-cancelledConstellation program: theOrion spacecraft(with theESMinstead of a US-built service module) and theSpace Launch System's (SLS)solid rocket boosters(originally developed for theAres V). Other elements of the program, such as theLunar Gateway space stationand theHuman Landing System, are in development bygovernment space agenciesandprivate spaceflightcompanies, collaborations bound by theArtemis Accordsand governmental contracts. The Space Launch System, Orion spacecraft and the Human Landing System form the mainspaceflightinfrastructure for Artemis, and the Lunar Gateway plays a supporting role in human habitation. Supporting infrastructures for Artemis include theCommercial Lunar Payload Services,development of ground infrastructures,Artemis Base Campon the Moon, Moon rovers, and spacesuits. Some aspects of the program have been criticized, such as the use of anear-rectilinear halo orbitand the program's sustainability. Orion's first launch on the Space Launch System was originally set in 2016, but faced numerous delays; it launched on November 16, 2022, as theArtemis Imission, with robots and mannequins aboard. As of October 2025[update], the crewedArtemis IIlaunch is scheduled for Feb 2026, theArtemis IIIcrewed lunar landing is expected to launch no earlier than mid-2027, theArtemis IVdocking with the Lunar Gateway is planned for late 2028, theArtemis Vdocking with the European Space Agency'sESPRIT, Canada'sCanadarm3, and NASA'sLunar Terrain Vehicleis planned for early 2030, and the Artemis VI docking which is expected to integrate theCrew and Science Airlockwith theLunar Gateway stationis planned for early 2031. After Artemis VI, NASA plans yearly landings on the Moon from then on. The program faced its greatest existential threat as the economics of launch costs began to change drastically due toreusable launch vehiclesin the early 2020s. After multiple sessions of Congress debated the viability of the program, it was ultimately funded by passage of the2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The Artemis program is organized around a series of SLS missions. These space missions will increase in complexity and are scheduled to occur at intervals of a year or more. NASA and its partners have planned Artemis I through Artemis V missions; later Artemis missions have also been proposed. Each SLS mission centers on the launch of an SLS launch vehicle carrying anOrion spacecraft. Missions after Artemis II will depend on support missions launched by other organizations and spacecraft for support functions. Artemis I(2022) was the successful uncrewed test of the SLS and Orion, and was the first test flight for both craft.[i]The Artemis I mission placed Orion into a lunar orbit and then returned to Earth. The SLS Block 1 design uses theInterim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage(ICPS) second stage, which performs the trans-lunar injection burn to send Orion to lunar space. For Artemis I, Orion braked into a polar distant retrogradelunar orbitand remained for about six days before boosting back toward Earth. The Orion capsule separated from its service module, re-entered the atmosphere foraerobraking, and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean under parachutes. Artemis II(2026) is planned to be the first crewed test flight of SLS and the Orion spacecraft.The four crew members will perform extensive testing in Earth orbit, and Orion will then be boosted into afree-return trajectory around the Moon, which will return Orion to Earth for re-entry and splashdown. Launch is scheduled for no later than April 2026. Artemis III(2027) is planned to be the first American crewed lunar landing since Apollo 17 in December 1972.The mission depends on a support mission to place aStarship Human Landing System(HLS) in anear-rectilinear halo orbit(NRHO) of the Moon prior to the launch of SLS/Orion. After Starship HLS reaches NRHO, SLS/Orion will send the Orion spacecraft with a crew of four to dock with HLS.[ii]Two astronauts will transfer to HLS, which will descend to the lunar surface and spend about 6.5 days on the surface.The astronauts will perform at least twoExtravehicular Activities(EVAs) on the surface before the HLS ascends to return them to a rendezvous with Orion. Orion will return the four astronauts to Earth. Launch is scheduled for no earlier than mid-2027. Artemis IV(2028) is planned to be the second crewed lunar landing mission. Orion and an upgradedStarship HLSwill dock with the Lunar Gateway station in NRHO prior to the landing. A prior support mission will deliver the first two Lunar Gateway modules to NRHO. The extra power of this mission's SLS Block 1B will allow it to deliver the I-HAB Gateway module for connection to the Lunar Gateway. Launch is scheduled for no earlier than September 2028. Artemis V(2030) is planned to be the third crewed lunar landing, which will deliver four astronauts to the Lunar Gateway station. The mission will deliver theEuropean Space Agency'sESPRITrefueling and communications module andCanadarm3, a Canadian-built robotic arm system for the Gateway. Also delivered will be NASA'sLunar Terrain Vehicle. Launch is scheduled for no earlier than March 2030.The mission will also be the first to useBlue Origin'sBlue Moonlander to take astronauts to the Moon's surface. Artemis VI(2031) is planned to be the fourth crewed lunar landing, which will integrate theCrew and Science Airlockwith the Gateway space station.Launch is scheduled for no earlier than March 2031.As of 2024, the Airlock module is under construction. Artemis VII(2032) is planned to be the fifth crewed lunar landing, which will deliver the Habitable Mobility Platform (Lunar Cruiser) to the surface of the moon on an SLS Block 1B rocket. Launch is scheduled for no earlier than March 2032. Artemis VIII(2033) is planned to be the sixth crewed lunar landing, which will have a lunar landing with the delivery of lunar surface logistics and the Foundational Surface Habitat using an SLS Block 1B rocket with the aid of Blue Origin. Launch is scheduled for no earlier than 2033. Artemis IX (2034) is planned to be the seventh crewed lunar landing, which will have another lunar landing with the delivery of additional lunar surface logistics. Unlike Artemis VIII, however, this mission will be the first to use an SLS Block 2 rocket. Artemis X (2035) is planned to be the eighth crewed lunar landing, which will feature the delivery of additional lunar surface logistics using an SLS Block 2 rocket, and will also include astronauts staying on the moon for an extended period of time. For many Artemis program missions, the Space Launch System's two solid rocket boosters' engines and casings and four main engines and the Orion spacecraft's main engine will all be previously flownSpace Shuttle main engines,solid rocket boosters, andOrbital Maneuvering Systemengines. They are refurbished legacy engines from the Space Shuttle program, some of which even date back to the early 1980s. For example, Artemis I had components that flew on 83 of the 135 Space Shuttle missions. From Artemis I to Artemis IV recycled Shuttle main engines will be used before manufacturing new engines. From Artemis I to Artemis III recycled Shuttle solid rocket boosters' engines and steel casings will be used before manufacturing new ones. From Artemis I to Artemis VI the Orion main engine will use six previously flown Space Shuttle OMS engines. Support missions include robotic landers, delivery of Gateway modules, Gateway logistics, delivery of the HLS, and delivery of elements of the Moon base. Most of these missions are executed under NASA contracts to commercial providers. Under theCommercial Lunar Payload Services(CLPS) program, several robotic landers will deliver scientific instruments and robotic rovers to the lunar surface after Artemis I. Additional CLPS missions are planned throughout the Artemis program to deliver payloads to the Moon base. These include habitat modules and rovers in support of crewed missions. A Human Landing System (HLS) is a spacecraft that can convey crew members from NRHO to the lunar surface, support them on the surface, and return them to NRHO. Each crewed landing needs one HLS, although some or all of the spacecraft may be reusable. Each HLS must be launched from Earth and delivered to NRHO in one or more launches. The initial commercial contract was awarded to SpaceX for two Starship HLS missions, one uncrewed and one crewed as part of Artemis III. These two missions each require one HLS launch and multiple fueling launches, all onSpaceX Starshiplaunchers. NASA later exercised an option under the initial contract to commission an upgraded Starship HLS for Artemis IV and a separate contract toBlue Originto develop a third crewed lunar lander, which will make its first crewed flight as part of the Artemis V mission. The first two Gateway modules (PPE and HALO) will be delivered to NRHO in a single launch using aFalcon Heavylauncher. Originally planned to be available prior to Artemis III, as of 2021 it is planned for availability before Artemis IV. The Gateway will be resupplied and supported by launches ofDragon XLspacecraft launched by Falcon Heavy. Each Dragon XL will remain attached to Gateway for up to six months. The Dragon XLs will not return to Earth, but will be disposed of, probably by deliberate crashes on the lunar surface. The Artemis program incorporates several major components of previously cancelledNASAprograms and missions, including theConstellation programand theAsteroid Redirect Mission. Originally legislated by theNASA Authorization Act of 2005, Constellation included the development ofAres I,Ares V, and the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle. The program ran from the early 2000s until 2010. In May 2009, U.S. PresidentBarack Obamaestablished theAugustine Committeeto take into account several objectives including support for theInternational Space Station, development of missions beyondlow Earth orbit(including the Moon, Mars, andnear-Earth objects), and use of the commercial space industry within defined budget limits.The committee concluded that the Constellation program was massively underfunded and that a 2020 Moon landing was impossible. Constellation was subsequently put on hold. On April 15, 2010,President Obama spoke at the Kennedy Space Center, announcing the administration's plans for NASA and cancelling the non-Orion elements of Constellation on the premise that the program had become nonviable.He instead proposed US$6 billion in additional funding and called for development of a new heavy-lift rocket program to be ready for construction by 2015 with crewed missions to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. On October 11, 2010, President Obama signed into law theNASA Authorization Act of 2010, which included requirements for the immediate development of the Space Launch System as a follow-on launch vehicle to theSpace Shuttle, and continued development of aCrew Exploration Vehicleto be capable of supporting missions beyond low Earth orbit starting in 2016, while making use of the workforce, assets, and capabilities of theSpace Shuttle program, Constellation program, and other NASA programs. The law also invested in space technologies and robotics capabilities tied to the overall space exploration framework, ensured continued support forCommercial Orbital Transportation Services,Commercial Resupply Services, and expanded theCommercial Crew Developmentprogram. On June 30, 2017, PresidentDonald Trumpsigned an executive order to re-establish theNational Space Council, chaired by Vice-PresidentMike Pence. The Trump administration's first budget request kept Obama-era human spaceflight programs in place: Commercial Resupply Services, Commercial Crew Development, the Space Launch System, and the Orion spacecraft for deep space missions, while reducing Earth science research and calling for the elimination of NASA's education office. On December 11, 2017, President Trump signedSpace Policy Directive 1, a change in national space policy that provides for a U.S.-led, integrated program with private sector partners for a human return to the Moon, followed by missions to Mars and beyond. The policy calls for the NASA administrator to "lead an innovative and sustainable program of exploration withcommercialand international partners to enable human expansion across theSolar Systemand to bring back to Earth new knowledge and opportunities". The effort intends to more effectively organize government, private industry, and international efforts toward returning humans to the Moon and laying the foundation of eventual humanexploration of Mars. Space Policy Directive 1 authorized the lunar-focused campaign. The campaign, later named Artemis, draws upon legacy US spacecraft programs, including theOrionspace capsule, theLunar Gatewayspace station, andCommercial Lunar Payload Services, and creates entirely new programs such as the Human Landing System. The in-development Space Launch System is expected to serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion, while commercial launch vehicles will launch various other elements of the program. On March 26, 2019, Vice PresidentMike Penceannounced that NASA's Moon landing goal would be accelerated by four years with a planned landing in 2024.On May 16, 2019, NASA AdministratorJim Bridenstineannounced that the new program would be namedArtemis, after the goddess of the Moon inGreek mythologywho is the twin sister ofApollo.Despite the immediate new goals, Mars missions by the 2030s were still intended as of May 2019[update]. In mid-2019, NASA requested US$1.6 billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year 2020,while the Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a five-year budget profilewhich is needed for evaluation and approval byCongress. In February 2020, theWhite Houserequested a funding increase of 12% to cover the Artemis program as part of itsfiscal year 2021 budget. The total budget would have been US$25.2 billion per year with US$3.7 billion dedicated toward a Human Landing System. NASA Chief Financial OfficerJeff DeWitsaid he thought the agency has "a very good shot" to get this budget through Congress despite Democratic concerns around the program.However, in July 2020 theHouse Appropriations Committeerejected the White House's requested funding increase.The bill proposed in the House dedicated only US$700 million toward the Human Landing System, 81% (US$3 billion) short of the requested amount. In April 2020, NASA awarded funding to Blue Origin, Dynetics, and SpaceX for 10-month-long preliminary design studies for the HLS. Throughout February 2021, Acting Administrator of NASASteve Jurczykreiterated those budget concerns when asked about the project's schedule,clarifying that "The 2024 lunar landing goal may no longer be a realistic target [...]". On February 4, 2021, theBiden administrationendorsed the Artemis program.More specifically, White House Press SecretaryJen Psakiexpressed the Biden administration's "support [for] this effort and endeavor". On April 16, 2021, NASA contractedSpaceXto develop, manufacture, and fly two lunar landing flights with theStarship HLSlunar lander.Blue Origin and Dynetics protested the award to theGovernment Accountability Office(GAO) on April 26.After the GAO rejected the protests,Blue Origin sued NASA over the award,and NASA agreed to stop work on the contract until November 1 as the lawsuit proceeded. The judge dismissed the suit on November 4, and NASA resumed work with SpaceX. On September 25, 2021, NASA released its first digital, interactive graphic novel in celebration of National Comic Book Day. "First Woman: NASA's Promise for Humanity" is the fictional story of Callie Rodriguez, the first woman to explore the Moon.In March 2025, with thediversity, equity, and inclusion policies of the second Trump administration, this was removed from NASA's web pages,together with other information about the graphic novel.[clarification needed] On November 15, 2021, an audit ofNASA's Office of Inspector Generalestimated the true cost of the Artemis program at about $93 billion until 2025. In addition to the initial SpaceX contract, NASA awarded two rounds of separate contracts in May 2019and September 2021,on aspects of the HLS to encourage alternative designs, separately from the initial HLS development effort. It announced in March 2022 that it was developing new sustainability rules and pursuing both a Starship HLS upgrade (an option under the initial SpaceX contract) and new competing alternative designs. These came after criticism from members of Congress over lack of redundancy and competition, and led NASA to ask for additional support. Artemis I was originally scheduled for late 2016, and as delays accrued, eventually for late 2021, but the launch date was then pushed back to August 29, 2022.Various delays related to final infrastructure repairs and weather pushed the launch date further out. In October 2022, NASA launch managers decided on a new launch date in November, which were again slightly delayed due to preparation and weather.On November 16 at 01:47:44 EST (06:47:44 UTC), Artemis I successfully launched from theKennedy Space Center. Artemis I was completed at 09:40 PST (17:40 UTC) on December 11, when the Orion spacecraft splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, west of Baja California, after a record-breaking mission, which saw Artemis travel more than 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) on a path around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. The splashdown occurred 50 years to the day since NASA'sApollo 17Moon landing, the last human crewed mission to touch down on the lunar surface. Artemis II is scheduled to launch in early 2026 as a crewed lunar flyby. TheEuropean Service Modulefor the mission was completed and handed over to NASA in 2023.Testing is underway on the Orion module for Artemis II. In April 2024, Lockheed was on track to hand over the Orion module by September after testing was complete.A NASAOIGreport released on May 1 reported the mission was still on track, provided corrective actions on the Orion heat shield were made.The Artemis II crew planned to conduct a series of trainings and simulations prior to launch, the first of which occurred in May 2024. TheSLS core stagefor the mission was delivered toKennedy Space Center(KSC) in July 2024.Notably, the SLS core stage for Artemis II was the last to be fully built at theMichoud Assembly Facility: future missions starting with Artemis III will have the core stage partly built after arriving at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, managed byExploration Ground Systems, which was deemed to be more efficient by program officials.In July, the Orion spacecraft was moved from the testing cell to the altitude chamber inside theNeil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Buildingat KSC.Rocket stacking operations began on November 20, 2024, when the left aft assembly of the booster was stacked onto the Mobile Launcher. The stacking marked a crucial step for launch in late 2025. On December 5, 2024, NASA delayed the Artemis II mission from September 2025 to April 2026, citing damage found to the heat shield of the uncrewed Orion capsule that flew on the Artemis I mission in 2022.In March 2025, however, NASA announced in a statement to AmericaSpace that the mission might be accelerated and that the launch date could potentially be moved up by two months to February 2026, though this potential move has not been confirmed as of yet. In the statement, NASA's Public Affairs Office said: "We're looking for ways to enable an earlier launch if possible, potentially launching as soon as February 2026. A February target allows the agency to capitalize on efficiencies in the flow of operations to integrate the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket, Orion spacecraft, and supporting ground systems while maintaining crew safety as the top priority." Artemis II is to be crewed by four astronauts: CommanderReid Wiseman, PilotVictor J. Glover, Payload SpecialistChristina Koch, and Mission SpecialistJeremy Hansen.Jenni Sidey-Gibbonsis Hansen's backup; she will join the mission if Hansen is unable to. Glover, Koch, and Hansen are planned to be the firstperson of color, woman, and non-US citizen to go beyondlow Earth orbit, respectively.Hansen and Sidey-Gibbons areCanadianand have been assigned by theCanadian Space Agency;a 2020 treaty between the United States and Canada led to their involvement. Artemis III is expected to launch in mid-2027 as the first crewed landing on the Moon since Apollo 17. In February 2024, NASA completed full qualification testing of the docking systems onStarship HLS.Also in February, the bulk of the manufacturing for the core stage of the SLS to be used in the mission was completed.In April 2024, NASA completed Starship’s first internal propellant transfer demonstration. The Starship’s tanker variant ability to act as anorbital propellant depotto Starship HLS is a key capability necessary to complete the Artemis III mission. A ship-to-ship propellant transfer demonstration to further prove out the capability is expected in 2025. TheEuropean Service Modulefor the mission was reported on track to be handed over to NASA in summer 2024.The first integrated test for the mission, which included the next generation space suits developed by Axiom Space, and the airlock module of Starship HLS was conducted in June 2024. On December 5, 2024, NASA delayed the Artemis III mission from September 2026 to mid-2027, citing damage found to the heat shield of the uncrewed Orion capsule that flew on the Artemis I mission in 2022. In March 2024, NASA announced the scientific instruments to be included on the mission were a compact, autonomous seismometer suite called the Lunar Environment Monitoring Station, or LEMS. LEMS will characterize the regional structure of the Moon's crust and mantle, to inform the development of lunar formation and evolution models. Another instrument is the Lunar Effects on Agricultural Flora, a.k.a. LEAF, which will investigate the impact of the lunar surface environment on space crops. The third instrument is the Lunar Dielectric Analyzer, or LDA, an internationally contributed payload that will measure the regolith's ability to propagate an electric field. Artemis IV is expected to launch in September 2028. Prior to the launch of the mission, aFalcon Heavyis planned to launch the first twoLunar Gatewayelements: thePower and Propulsion ElementandHabitation and Logistics Outpost,now scheduled for 2027. Artemis IV will then be responsible for launching with a crew with theInternational Habitation Module(I-Hab) and adding the module to the Gateway space station. SLS Block 1B manufacture began in March 2024.The I-Hab module construction was underway as of April 2024. In May 2024, it was reported NASA made significant progress towards completion of Mobile Launcher 2 (ML-2), the launch platform that will be used by the larger SLS Block 1B.In August 2024, the NASA Inspector General estimated that the launch platform could end up costing the agency $2.5 billion, more than six times its original value and may not be ready to support a launch until 2029, making the current launch schedule unrealistic. NASA has highlighted five key points for the mission, in chronological order: Artemis V is expected to launch in March 2030. The mission will launch four astronauts on a Space Launch System rocket and anOrionspacecraft to theLunar Gateway. It will be the third lunar landing of the Artemis program. Artemis V will deliver two new elements to the Gateway space station.After docking to the Gateway, two astronauts will board theBlue Moonlunar lander and fly it to theLunar south poleto land near theLunar Terrain Vehicle(LTV). This will be the first lunar landing sinceApollo 17to use an unpressurized lunar rover. NASA has highlighted five key points for the mission, in chronological order: Artemis VI is expected to launch in March 2031.The primary objectives of this mission are to integrate theCrew and Science Airlock Modulewith Gateway, and to complete the fourth crewed lunar surface expedition of the Artemis missions.As of 2024, the Airlock module is under construction byMohammed bin Rashid Space Centre. NASA has highlighted five key points for the mission, in chronological order: Artemis VII is expected to launch in March 2032. The objectives are to deliver the Habitable Mobility Platform (Lunar Cruiser) to the surface of the moon on an SLS Block 1B rocket. The mission is expected to last around 30 days. Artemis VIII is expected to launch in 2033. The mission will have a lunar landing, with the delivery of lunar surface logistics and the Foundational Surface Habitat, using an SLS Block 1B rocket with the aid of Blue Origin. The mission is expected to last around 60 days. Artemis IX is expected to launch in 2034. The mission will have another lunar landing with the delivery of additional lunar surface logistics. This mission will be the first to use an SLS Block 2 rocket. The mission is expected to last around 60 days. Artemis X is planned to launch in 2035. This mission will feature the delivery of additional lunar surface logistics, and will include astronauts staying on the moon long-term. The mission is expected to last up to 180 days. As of 2025, additional missions beyond Artemis X have not officially been discussed. Additionally, theNASA Inspector Generalhas stated that the current launch timeline is "unrealistic" and will likely be further delayed. Implementation of the Artemis program will require additional programs, projects, and commercial launchers to support the construction of the Lunar Gateway, launch resupply missions to the station, and deploy numerous robotic spacecraft and instruments to the lunar surface.Several precursor robotic missions are being coordinated through theCommercial Lunar Payload Services(CLPS) program, which is dedicated to scouting and characterization oflunar resourcesas well as testing principles forin-situ resource utilization(ISRU). In March 2018,NASAestablished theCommercial Lunar Payload Services(CLPS) program with the aim of sending small roboticlandersand rovers mostly to thelunar south pole regionas a precursor to and in support of crewed missions.The main goals include scouting oflunar resources, ISRU feasibility testing, and lunar science.NASA is awarding commercial providersindefinite delivery/indefinite quantitycontracts to develop and fly lunar landers with scientific payloads.The first phase considered proposals capable of delivering at least 10 kg (22 lb) of payload by the end of 2021.Proposals for mid-sized landers capable of delivering between 500 kg (1,100 lb) and 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of cargo were planned to also be considered for launch beyond 2021. In November 2018, NASA announced the first nine companies that were qualified to bid on the CLPS transportation service contracts (see list below).On 31 May 2019, three of those were awarded lander contracts:Astrobotic Technology,Intuitive Machines, andOrbitBeyond.On July 29, 2019, NASA announced that it had granted OrbitBeyond's request to be released from obligations under the contract citing "internal corporate challenges". The first twelve payloads and experiments from NASA centers were announced on February 21, 2019.On July 1, 2019, NASA announced the selection of twelve additional payloads, provided by universities and industry. Seven of these are scientific investigations while five are technology demonstrations. The Lunar Surface Instrument and Technology Payloads (LSITP) program was soliciting payloads in 2019 that do not require significant additional development. They will include technology demonstrators to advance lunar science or the commercial development of the Moon. In November 2019, NASA added five contractors to the group of companies who are eligible to bid to send large payloads to the surface of the Moon under the CLPS program:Blue Origin,Ceres Robotics,Sierra Nevada Corporation,SpaceX, andTyvak Nano-Satellite Systems. In April 2020, NASA selectedMasten Space Systemsfor a follow-on CLPS delivery of cargo to the Moon in 2022.On June 23, 2021, Masten Space Systems announced it was delayed until November 2023. Dave Masten, the founder and chief technology officer, blamed the delay on the COVID pandemic and industry-wide supply chain issues. In February 2021, NASA selectedFirefly Aerospacefor a CLPS launch toMare Crisiumin mid-2023. On May 5, 2020,Reutersreported that theTrump administrationwas drafting a new international agreement outlining the laws formining on the Moon.NASA AdministratorJim Bridenstineofficially announced the Artemis Accords on May 15, 2020. It consists of a series of multilateral agreements between the governments of participating nations in the Artemis program "grounded in theOuter Space Treaty of 1967".The Artemis Accords have been criticized by some American researchers as "a concerted, strategic effort to redirect international space cooperation in favor of short-term U.S. commercial interests". The Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) Program is one of three NASA programs based at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. EGS was established to develop and operate the systems and facilities necessary to process and launch rockets and spacecraft during assembly, transport, and launch.EGS is preparing the infrastructure to support NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and its payloads, such as theOrion spacecraftfor Artemis I. TheLunar Gatewayis a space station to be constructed in lunar orbit, and the Gateway Logistics Services program will provide cargo and other supplies to the station, even when crews are not present.As of 2022[update], only SpaceX's supply vehicle, known asDragon XL, is planned to supply the Gateway. Dragon XL is a version of theDragon spacecraft, to be launched by theFalcon Heavy. UnlikeDragon 2and its predecessor, it is intended to be an expendable spacecraft. As of the early mission concepts outlined by NASA in May 2020 and refined by the HLS contract award in July 2021, the primary Earth-launch vehicles planned to support the Artemis program will include the NASA Space Launch System for theOrion vehicle, theFalcon Heavyfor various components of theLunar Gateway,and the Starship HLS configuration for the eventual delivery of theHLS vehicle. Other standard SpaceX Starships may be used later to meet other and yet to be determined crew and/or cargo handling mission needs.Additional launch vehicles will also be employed later for CLPS cargo services. The EuropeanAriane 6has been proposed to be part of the program in July 2019. ThePower and Propulsion Element(PPE) module and theHabitation and Logistics Outpost(HALO) of theGateway, which were previously planned for theSLS Block 1B,will now fly together on aFalcon Heavyin 2027.The Gateway will be supported and resupplied by approximately 28 commercial cargo missions launched by undetermined commercial launch vehicles.TheGateway Logistics Services(GLS) will be in charge of resupply missions.GLS has also contracted for the construction of a resupply vehicle, Dragon XL, capable of remaining docked to the Gateway for one year of operations, providing and generating its own power while docked, and capable of autonomous disposal at the end of its mission. In May 2019, the plan was for components of a crewed lunar lander to be deployed to the Gateway on commercial launchers before the arrival of the first crewed mission,Artemis III.An alternative approach where the HLS and Orion dock together directly was discussed. As late as mid-2019, NASA considered use ofDelta IV Heavyand Falcon Heavy to launch a crewed Orion mission given SLS delays.Given the complexity of conversion to a different vehicle, the agency ultimately decided to use only the SLS to launch astronauts. LEO: Low Earth OrbitTLI: Trans-Lunar Injection TheSpace Launch System(SLS) is a United Statessuper heavy-liftexpendable launch vehicle, which has been under development since its announcement in 2011. The SLS is the main Earth-launch vehicle of the Artemis lunar program, as of March 2021[update]. NASA is required by theU.S. Congressto use SLS Block 1, which will be powerful enough to lift apayloadof 95 metric tons (209,000 lb) tolow Earth orbit(LEO), and will launchArtemis I,II, andIII.Starting in 2028, Block 1B is intended to debut theExploration Upper Stage(EUS) and launch the notional Artemis IV–VII. Starting in 2029, Block 2 is planned to replace the initial Shuttle-derived boosters with advanced boosters and would have a LEO capability of more than 130 metric tons (290,000 lb), again as required by Congress.Block 2 is intended to enable crewed launches toMars.The SLS will launch theOrion spacecraftand use the ground operations capabilities and launch facilities at NASA'sKennedy Space CenterinFlorida. In March 2019, theTrump administrationreleased itsFiscal Year 2020 Budget Requestfor NASA. This budget did not initially include any money for the Block 1B and Block 2 variants of SLS, but later a request for a budget increase of $1.6 billion towards SLS, Orion, and crewed landers was made. Block 1B is now intended to debut on Artemis IV and will be used mainly for co-manifested crew transfers and logistics rather than constructing the Gateway as initially planned. An uncrewed Block 1B was planned to launch theLunar Surface Assetin 2028, the first lunar outpost of the Artemis program, but now that launch has been moved to a commercial launcher.Block 2development will most likely start in the late 2020s after NASA is regularly visiting the lunar surface and shifts focus towards Mars. In October 2019, NASA authorizedBoeingto purchase materials in bulk for more SLS rockets ahead of the announcement of a new contract. The contract was expected to support up to ten core stages and eightExploration Upper Stagesfor the SLS 1B to transfer heavy payloads of up to 40 metric tons on a lunar trajectory. Boeing, the main contractor for the SLS, informed its employees working on the rocket on February 7, 2025, that they may be laid off when its contract expires, suggesting theTrump Administrationmay propose canceling the SLS.The release of Trump's fiscal year 2026 budget proposal for NASA on May 2 involved cutting $6 billion (24%) from NASA's $24.8 billion budget and allocating $1 billion to SpaceX.If approved, the budget will cancel the SLS and Orion spacecraft after Artemis III due to the SLS's cost of $4 billion per launch,as well as theLunar Gateway. On July 4, 2025, President Donald Trump signed theOne Big Beautiful Bill Act, which allocates $10 billion for NASA; this includes $700 million for aMars Telecommunications Orbiter(a project which was initially cancelled in 2005); $2.6 billion for theLunar Gatewayspace station; $4.1 billion for the development of theSpace Launch Systemrockets for theArtemis IVandArtemis Vmissions; $20 million for the Artemis IVOrionspacecraft; $1.25 billion forInternational Space Stationoperations throughout 2030; $325 million for theU.S. Deorbit Vehicle; $1 billion for improvements at five NASA centers ($300 million forJohnson Space Center, $250 million forKennedy Space Center, $120 million forStennis Space Center, $100 million forMarshall Space Flight Centerand $30 million forMichoud Assembly Facility); $85 million will also be allocated to transfer a space vehicle to a field center that is involved in the administration of theCommercial Crew Program(aimed at movingSpace Shuttle Discoveryto the Johnson Space Center). Thismeasureindicates that a cancellation of the Artemis program is highly unlikely. The SpaceX Starship system is a fully-reusablesuper heavy-liftEarth-launch system which is under development. It consists of a first-stage booster namedSuper-Heavyand a second-stage space vehicle which is generally namedStarshipand which will have several variants. A Starship HLS mission will use three variants: a tanker, a propellant depot, and theStarship HLSitself which will be designed only for lunar landings and takeoffs, and not for Earth landings. Some variants will be able to return to Earth for reuse. The second-stage Starships are fully self-contained spacecraft, complete with their own propulsion systems. The combined Starship system using standard Starship variants for its second-stage is planned to launch crews and cargo, which may then be used to support the various developmental needs of the Artemis program, and also to support the needs of other NASA and SpaceX programs. The SpaceX Starship is also qualified to be bid forCommercial Lunar Payload Services(CLPS) launches, and in 2021 was the winning NASA bid for a crewed lunar landing. The SpaceX Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launcher. It will be used to launch the first two Gateway modules into NRHO.It will also be used to launch the Dragon XL spacecraft on supply missions to Gateway,and it is qualified to be bid for other launches under the CLPS program. It was selected under CLPS to launch the VIPER mission, though this mission was later cancelled in 2024 due to cost overruns and mission delays. Under the CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Service) program, qualified CLPS vendors can use any launcher that meets their mission requirements. Orion is a class ofpartially reusablespacecraft to be used in the Artemis program. The spacecraft consists of a Crew Module (CM)space capsuledesigned byLockheed Martinand theEuropean Service Module(ESM) manufactured byAirbus Defence and Space. Capable of supporting a crew of six beyondlow Earth orbit, Orion is equipped withsolar panels, anautomated docking system, andglass cockpitinterfaces modeled after those used in theBoeing 787 Dreamliner. It has a singleAJ10engine for primary propulsion, and others includingreaction control systemengines. Although designed to be compatible with otherlaunch vehicles, Orion is primarily intended to launch atop aSpace Launch System(SLS) rocket, with a towerlaunch escape system. Orion was originally conceived by Lockheed Martin as a proposal for theCrew Exploration Vehicle(CEV) to be used in NASA'sConstellation program. Following the cancellation of the Constellation program in 2010, Orion was heavily redesigned for use in NASA's Journey to Mars initiative; later named Moon to Mars. TheSLSreplaced theAres Ias Orion's primary launch vehicle, and the service module was replaced with a design based on theEuropean Space Agency'sAutomated Transfer Vehicle. A development version of Orion's CM was launched in 2014 duringExploration Flight Test-1, while at least four test articles were produced. By 2022, three flight-worthy Orion crew modules have been built, with an additional one ordered, for use in the Artemis program; the first of these was due to be launched on November 30, 2020, however,Artemis Idid not launch until November 16, 2022. On March 27, 2020, SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL resupply spacecraft to carry pressurized and unpressurized cargo, experiments and other supplies to NASA's plannedLunar Gatewayunder aGateway Logistics Services(GLS) contract.The equipment delivered by Dragon XL missions could include sample collection materials, spacesuits and other items astronauts may need on the Gateway and on the surface of theMoon, according toNASA. It will launch on SpaceXFalcon Heavyrockets fromLC-39Aat theKennedy Space CenterinFlorida. The Dragon XL will stay at the Gateway for 6 to 12 months at a time, when research payloads inside and outside the cargo vessel could be operated remotely, even when crews are not present.Its payload capacity is expected to be more than 5,000 kilograms (11,000 lb) to lunar orbit.There is no requirement for a return to Earth. At the end of the mission the Dragon XL must be able to undock and dispose of the same mass it can bring to the Gateway, by moving the spacecraft to a heliocentric orbit. On February 22, 2023, NASA discussed the Dragon XL's development for the first time since its 2020 unveiling, with Mark Wiese, NASA's manager of deep space logistics for the Gateway program, answering during a panel atSpaceComthat NASA has been working with SpaceX to run a series of studies to refine the Dragon XL design and examine cargo configurations and other capabilities that could be enabled by the spacecraft.Wiese also elaborated that Dragon XL would be used for initial missions, and stating that "[NASA] talked to [SpaceX] aboutStarshipevolution and how it all worked together, but we’re not there yet because it's still in a development phase" hinting that Starship will eventually replace Dragon XL once it completes development. The Human Landing System (HLS) is a critical component of the Artemis mission. This system transports crew from lunar orbit (the Gateway or an Orion spacecraft) to the lunar surface, acts as a lunar habitat, and then transports the crew back to lunar orbit. In 2021 SpaceX'sStarship HLSprogram was awarded the winning NASA bid for the production of a crewed lunar landing vehicle.In May 2023,Blue Originwas selected as the second provider for lunar lander services. Bidding for NASA's HLS lunar landing vehicle began in 2019. At that time, NASA elected to have the HLS designed and developed by commercial vendors. Eleven competing contracts were initially awarded in May 2019. In April 2020, NASA awarded three competing design contracts, and in April 2021, NASA selected theStarship HLSto proceed to development and production. Separate from its early design and development program for its first HLS spacecraft, NASA retains multiple smaller contracts to study various elements of alternative HLS designs. The Starship Human Landing System (Starship HLS) was the winner selected by NASA for potential use for long-duration crewed lunar landings as part of NASA's Artemis program. Starship HLS is a variant of SpaceX'sStarship spacecraftoptimized to operate on and around the Moon. In contrast to the Starship spacecraft from which it derives, Starship HLS will never re-enter an atmosphere, so it does not have aheat shieldorflight control surfaces. In contrast to other proposed HLS designs that used multiple stages, the entire spacecraft will land on the Moon and will then launch from the Moon. Like other Starship variants, Starship HLS hasRaptorengines mounted at the tail as its primary propulsion system. However, when it is within "tens of meters" of the lunar surface during descent and ascent, it will use high-thrust methane/oxygen RCS thrusters located mid-body instead of the Raptors to avoid raising dust viaplume impingement. A solar array located on the nose below the docking port provides electrical power. Elon Musk stated that Starship HLS would be able to deliver "potentially up to 200 tons" to the lunar surface. Starship HLS would be launched to Earth orbit using the SpaceXSuper Heavy booster, and would use a series of tanker spacecraft to refuel the Starship HLS vehicle in Earth orbit for lunar transit and lunar landing operations, a capability referred to asorbital refueling. Starship HLS would then boost itself to lunar orbit for rendezvous with Orion. In the mission concept, a NASA Orion spacecraft would carry a NASA crew to the lander, where they would depart and descend to the surface of the Moon. After lunar surface operations, Starship HLS would lift off from the lunar surface acting as asingle-stage-to-orbit(SSTO) vehicle and return the crew to Orion. On May 19, 2023, NASA announced an additional contract to Blue Origin to develop a second crewed lunar lander, which will make its first crewed flight as part of theArtemis Vmission. Blue Moon is smaller than the SpaceX HLS lander, having only 20 tons of payload capacity. The lander is fueled with a combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants. NASA's Gateway is an in-developmentmini-space stationinlunar orbitintended to serve as a solar-powered communication hub, science laboratory, short-term habitation module, and holding area for rovers and other robots.While the project is led by NASA, the Gateway is meant to be developed, serviced, and used in collaboration with commercial and international partners: Canada (Canadian Space Agency) (CSA), Europe (European Space Agency) (ESA), and Japan (JAXA). ThePower and Propulsion Element(PPE) started development at theJet Propulsion Laboratoryduring the now canceledAsteroid Redirect Mission(ARM). The original concept was a robotic, high performancesolar electricspacecraft that would retrieve a multi-ton boulder from an asteroid and bring it to lunar orbit for study.When ARM was canceled, the solar electric propulsion was repurposed for the Gateway.The PPE will allow access to the entire lunar surface and act as aspace tugfor visiting craft.It will also serve as the command and communications center of the Gateway.The PPE is intended to have a mass of 8–9 tonnes and the capability to generate 50 kWofsolar electric powerfor itsion thrusters, which can be supplemented by chemical propulsion. The Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO),also called the Minimal Habitation Module (MHM) and formerly known as the Utilization Module,will be built byNorthrop Grumman Innovation Systems(NGIS).A single Falcon Heavy equipped with an extended fairingwill launch the PPE together with the HALO in 2027.The HALO is based on aCygnusCargo resupply moduleto the outside of which radial docking ports, body mounted radiators (BMRs), batteries and communications antennae will be added. The HALO will be a scaled-down habitation module,yet, it will feature a functional pressurized volume providing sufficient command, control, and data handling capabilities, energy storage and power distribution, thermal control, communications and tracking capabilities, two axial and up to two radial docking ports, stowage volume, environmental control andlife support systemsto augment the Orion spacecraft and support a crew of four for at least 30 days. In late October 2020, NASA andEuropean Space Agency(ESA) finalized an agreement to collaborate in the Gateway program. ESA will provide a habitat module in partnership withJAXA(I-HAB) and a refueling module (ESPRIT). In return, Europe will have three flight opportunities to launch crew aboard the Orion crew capsule, for which they will provide the service module. In 2024, the HALO module reached substantial completion and entered into the stress test phase, following successful completion of which it will be shipped from Europe to the US in preparation for configuration with the PPE module and launch. On January 10, 2020,NASA's 22nd astronaut group, nicknamed the "Turtles", graduated and were assigned to the Artemis program. The group includes twoCanadian Space Agency(CSA) astronauts. The group earned their nickname from the prior astronaut group, "The 8-Balls", as is a tradition dating back to "The Mercury Seven" in 1962 which subsequently provided the "Next Nine" with their nickname. They were given this name, for the most part, because ofHurricane Harvey. Some of the astronauts will fly on the Artemis missions to the Moon and may be part of the first crew to fly to Mars. On December 9, 2020,vice presidentMike Penceannounced the first group of 18 astronauts (all American, including 9 male and 9 female from different backgrounds), the 1stArtemis team, who could be selected as astronauts of early missions of the Artemis program: Chief AstronautReid Wisemansaid in August 2022, however, that all 42 active members of theNASA Astronaut Corpsand ten more training asNASA Astronaut Group 23are eligible for Artemis II and later flights. The Artemis Base Camp will support missions of up to two months and will be used to study technologies to use on future Moon or Mars bases, and then future stationary modules may be used regularly for decades to come through both Government and commercial programs. Most probably it will be a site that has already been visited by prior robotic missions. It will consist of three main modules: In 2022, NASA has identified 13 candidate regions near the lunar South Pole for initial landing and inspection missions. In February 2020, NASA released tworequests for informationregarding both a crewed and uncrewed unpressurized surface rover. The latter, Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) would be prepositioned by a CLPS vehicle before the Artemis III mission. It would be used to transport crews around the exploration site and serve a similar function to the ApolloLunar Roving Vehicle. In July 2020, NASA established a program office for the rover at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. NASA has specified its need for a Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) that has a cargo capacity of 800 kg, traversal distances of up to 20 km without battery recharging, continuous operations for 8 hours within a 24-hour period, the ability to survive the lunar night, and the ability to traverse grades as steep as ±20 degrees. On April 3, 2024, NASA announced thatIntuitive Machines,Lunar Outpostand Venturi Astrolab are the three companies developing the LTV in a 12-month feasibility and demo phase.A source selection statement by NASA provided further details on cost and overall feasibility on April 9, 2024. The Intuitive Machines proposal was for $1.692 billion, Lunar Outpost for $1.727 billion and Astrolab for $1.928 billion to develop the vehicle. The Artemis Base Camp is the proposed lunar base to be established at the end of the 2020s. The Base camp is to be located in the south pole region near the two adjacentShackletonandde Gerlachecraters,due to this area's wide variety of lunar geography and also due to the abundance of water ice that is believed to exist in the lunar soils of the crater floors. The environs of these craters fall under the guidelines of theOuter Space Treaty. Most of the information about the Surface Habitat (SH) modules comes from studies and launch manifests which include a reference to its launch. It will be commercially built and commercially launched in the early 2030s along with thePressurized Vehicle (PV).The SH was formerly referred to as the Artemis Surface Asset. Launch plans as of February 2020[update]showed that landing it on the surface would be similar to the HLS. The SH would be sent to the Gateway where it would then be attached to a descent stage and subsequently transported to the lunar surface with a commercial launcher and lander. It would use the same lunar transfer stage as used for the HLS. Other designs from 2019 envisioned it being launched from anSLS Block 1Bas a single unit and landing directly on the surface. It would then be hooked up to a surface power system launched by a CLPS mission and tested by the Artemis VI crew.The Italian Space Agency signed a contract with Thales Alenia Space in late 2023 for theMulti Purpose Habitationmodule, which may become the second module for the Artemis Base Camp. As of February 2020, a lunar stay during a Phase 1 Artemis mission will be about seven days and will have fiveextravehicular activities(EVA). Anotionalconcept of operations, i.e., a hypothetical but possible plan, would include the following: On Day 1 of the stay, astronauts touchdown on the Moon but do not conduct an EVA. Instead, they prepare for the EVA scheduled for the next day, in what is referred to as "The Road to EVA". On Day 2, the astronauts open the hatch on the Human Landing System and embark on EVA 1, which will be six hours long. It will include collecting a contingency sample, conducting public affairs activities, deploying the experiment package, and acquiring samples. The astronauts will stay close to the landing site on this first EVA. EVA 2 begins on day 3. The astronauts characterize and collect samples frompermanently shadowed regions. Unlike the previous EVA, the astronauts will go farther from the landing site, up to 2 kilometres (1.2 mi), and up and down slopes of 20°. Day 4 will not include an EVA, but Day 5 will. EVA 3 may include activities such as collecting samples from an ejecta blanket. Day 6 will have the two astronauts deploy a geotechnical instrument alongside an environmental monitoring station forin-situ resource utilization (ISRU). Day 7 will have the final and shortest EVA. This EVA will last one hour, rather than the others' six hours in duration from egress to ingress, and mostly comprises preparations for the lunar ascent, including jettisoning hardware. Once the final EVA is concluded, the astronauts will return to the Human Landing System and the vehicle will launch from the surface and join up with Orion/Gateway. The Pressurized Rover (PR) is a large, pressurized module used to enable crewed operation across large distances and live for multiple days. NASA had developed multiple pressurized rovers including what was formerly called theSpace Exploration Vehicle(SEV). This rover was built for theConstellation programand was fabricated and then tested. In the 2020 flight manifest it was later referred to as the "Mobile Habitat" suggesting it could fill a similar role to theILREC Lunar Bus. It would be ready for the crew to use on the surface but could also be autonomously controlled from the Gateway or other locations. Mark Kirasich, who is the acting director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems, has stated that the current plan is to partner withJAXAandToyotato develop a closed cabin rover to support crews for up to 14 days (currently known asLunar Cruiser). "It's very important to our leadership at the moment to involve JAXA in a major surface element", he said. "... The Japanese, and their auto industry, have a very strong interest in rover-type things. So, there was an idea to—even though we have done a lot of work—to let the Japanese lead development of a pressurized rover. So right now, that's the direction we're heading in". In regard to the PR, senior-lunar-scientist Clive Neal said "Under Constellation, NASA had a sophisticated rover put together. It's pretty sad if it's never going to get to the Moon". However Neal also said that he understands the different mission objectives between the Constellation Program and those of the Artemis Program, and the need of the Artemis Program to focus more on international collaboration. On April 9, 2024, it was announced that JAXA and NASA had signed an agreement stipulating that Japan would join the pressurized rover collaboration venture and would design, develop, and operate a rover for crewed and uncrewed exploration of the Moon. In return, NASA will provide the launch and delivery of the rover to the Moon, as well as providing seats for two Japanese astronaut missions to the lunar surface, with the goal of these astronauts being the first non-Americans to travel to the Moon's surface. The pressurized rover is planned to accommodate two astronauts for up to 30 days outside. NASA plans to use the pressurized rover from Artemis VII and subsequent missions, over an approximate 10 year lifespan. The Artemis program will make use of two types ofspace suitrevealed in October 2019: theExploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU),and the Orion Crew Survival System (OCSS). On August 10, 2021, aNASA Office of Inspector Generalaudit reported a conclusion that the spacesuits would not be ready until April 2025 at the earliest, likely delaying the mission from the then planned late 2024.In response to the IG report,SpaceXindicated that they could provide the suits. NASA published a draft RFP to procure commercially-produced spacesuits in order to meet the 2024 schedule.On June 2, 2022, NASA announced that commercially produced spacesuits would be developed byAxiom SpaceandCollins Aerospace.In early 2024, the development reached the critical design and test phase. A prototype version of the Orion Crew Module was launched onExploration Flight Test-1on December 5, 2014atop aDelta IV Heavyrocket. Itsreaction control systemand other components were tested during twomedium Earth orbits, reaching an apogee of 5,800 km (3,600 mi) and crossing theVan Allen radiation beltsbefore making a high-energy re-entry at 32,000 km/h (20,000 mph). TheAscent Abort-2test on July 2, 2019, tested the final iteration of the launch abort system on a 10,000 kg (22,000 lb) Orionboilerplateat maximum aerodynamic load,using a customMinotaur IV-derived launch vehicle built byOrbital ATK. As of November 2022[update], all crewed Artemis missions will launch on the Space Launch System fromKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B. Current plans call for some supporting hardware to be launched on other vehicles and from other launch pads. In November 2021, plans to return humans to the Moon in 2024 were cancelled, and theArtemis IIImission was delayed until at least 2025. It has since been delayed to mid-2027.Artemis VII is expected to deliver a crew of four astronauts to asurface lunar outpostknown as the Foundation Habitat, along with the Mobile Habitat, which is expected to occur in March 2032.The Foundation Habitat would be launched back to back with the Mobile Habitat by an undetermined super heavy launcherand would be used for extended crewed lunar surface missions.Artemis VIII is expected to deliver a crew of astronauts to asurface lunar outpost, which is expected to occur in 2033, along with Artemis IX in 2034, Artemis X in 2035 and Artemis XI in 2036.[citation needed] Prior to each crewed Artemis mission, payloads to theGateway, such as refueling depots and expendable elements of the lunar lander, would be deployed by commercial launch vehicles.The most updated manifest includes missions suggested in NASA's timelines that have not been designed or funded from Artemis IV to IX. Artemis support missions are robotic missions flown through theCLPSprogram andGateway program, and HLS demo and delivery missions.The first one occurred on June 28, 2022. The Artemis program has received criticism from several space professionals. Mark Whittington, who is a contributor toThe Hilland an author of several space exploration studies, stated in an article that the "lunar orbit project doesn't help us get back to the Moon". Aerospace engineer, author, andMars SocietyfounderRobert Zubrinhas voiced his distaste for theGateway, which is part of the Artemis program as of 2027. He presented an alternative approach to a 2024 crewed lunar landing called "Moon Direct", a successor to his proposedMars Direct. His vision phases out the SLS and Orion, replacing them with theSpaceX launch vehiclesandSpaceX Dragon 2. It proposes using a heavy ferry/lander that would be refueled on the lunar surface viain situ resource utilizationand transfer the crew from LEO to the lunar surface. The concept bears a heavy resemblance to NASA's ownSpace Transportation Systemproposal from the 1970s. Apollo 11astronautBuzz Aldrindisagrees with NASA's current goals and priorities, including their plans for a lunar outpost. He questioned the benefit of the idea to "send a crew to an intermediate point in space, pick up a lander there and go down". However, Aldrin expressed support for Robert Zubrin's "Moon Direct" concept which involves lunar landers traveling from Earth orbit to the lunar surface and back. The program attracted criticism for the fact that at least 15 launches will be required to refuel HLS in orbit per crewed mission.In 2024, SpaceX's Jennifer Jensen stated on a call that Starship HLS will require ten launches.

Skylabwas the United States' firstspace station, launched byNASA,occupied for about 24 weeks between May 1973 and February 1974. It was operated by three trios of astronaut crews:Skylab 2,Skylab 3, andSkylab 4. Skylab was constructed from a repurposedSaturn Vthird stage (theS-IVB), and took the place of the stage during launch. Operations included an orbital workshop, asolar observatory,Earth observationand hundreds ofexperiments. Skylab's orbit eventually decayed and it disintegrated in the atmosphere on July 11, 1979, scattering debris across theIndian OceanandWestern Australia. As of 2025,[update]Skylab has been the onlyspace stationoperated exclusively by the United States. Apermanent stationwas planned starting in 1988, but its funding was canceled and U.S. participation shifted to theInternational Space Stationin 1993. Skylab had a mass of 199,750 pounds (90,610 kg) with a 31,000-pound (14,000 kg)Apollo command and service module(CSM) attachedand included a workshop, a solar observatory, and several hundred life science and physical science experiments. It was launched uncrewed intolow Earth orbitby aSaturn Vrocket modified to be similar to theSaturn INT-21, with theS-IVB, with Skylab itself being the repurposed third stage. This was the final flight for the rocket more commonly known for carrying the crewed Apollo Moon landing missions.Three subsequent missions delivered three-astronaut crews in the Apollo CSM launched by the smallerSaturn IBrocket. Skylab included theApollo Telescope Mount(a multi-spectral solar observatory), a multiple docking adapter with two docking ports, an airlock module withextravehicular activity(EVA) hatches, and the orbital workshop, the main habitable space inside Skylab. Electrical power came from solar arrays and fuel cells in the docked Apollo CSM. The rear of the station included a large waste tank, propellant tanks for maneuvering jets, and a heat radiator. Astronauts conducted numerous experiments aboard Skylab during its operational life. For the final two crewed missions to Skylab, NASA assembled a backup Apollo CSM/Saturn IB in case an in-orbit rescue mission was needed, but this vehicle was never flown. The station was damaged during launch when themicrometeoroid shieldtore away from the workshop, taking one of the main solar panel arrays with it and jamming the other main array. This deprived Skylab of most of its electrical power and also removed protection from intense solar heating, threatening to make it unusable. The first crew deployed a replacement heat shade and freed the jammed solar panels to save Skylab. This was the first time that a repair of this magnitude was performed in space. The Apollo Telescope significantly advanced solar science, and observation of theSunwas unprecedented. Astronauts took thousands of photographs of Earth, and theEarth Resources Experiment Package(EREP) viewed Earth with sensors that recorded data in thevisible,infrared, andmicrowavespectral regions. The record for human time spent in orbit was extended beyond the 23 days set by theSoyuz 11crew aboardSalyut 1to 84 days by theSkylab 4crew. Later plans to reuse Skylab were stymied by delays in the development of the Space Shuttle, and Skylab'sdecaying orbitcould not be stopped. Skylab's atmospheric reentry began on July 11, 1979,amid worldwide media attention. Before re-entry, NASA ground controllers tried to adjust Skylab's orbit to minimize the risk of debris landing in populated areas,targeting the south Indian Ocean, which was partially successful. Debris showeredWestern Australia, and recovered pieces indicated that the station had disintegrated lower than expected.As the Skylab program drew to a close, NASA's focus had shifted to the development of the Space Shuttle. NASA space station and laboratory projects includedSpacelab,Shuttle-Mir, andSpace StationFreedom, which was merged into the International Space Station. Rocket engineerWernher von Braun, science fiction writerArthur C. Clarke, and other early advocates of crewed space travel, expected until the 1960s that a space station would be an important early step in space exploration. Von Braun participated in the publishing of a series of influential articles inCollier'smagazine from 1952 to 1954, titled "Man Will Conquer Space Soon!". He envisioned a large, circular station 250 feet (75 m) in diameter that would rotate to generateartificial gravityand require a fleet of 7,000 short tons (6,400 metric tons)space shuttlesfor construction in orbit. The 80 men aboard the station would includeastronomersoperating a telescope,meteorologiststo forecast the weather, and soldiers to conduct surveillance. Von Braun expected that future expeditions to theMoonandMarswould leave from the station. The development of thetransistor, thesolar cell, andtelemetryled, in the 1950s and early 1960s, to uncrewed satellites that could take photographs of weather patterns or enemy nuclear weapons and send them to Earth. A large station was no longer necessary for such purposes, and the United StatesApollo programto send men to the Moon chose a mission mode that would not need in-orbit assembly. A smaller station that a single rocket could launch retained value, however, for scientific purposes. In 1959, von Braun, head of the Development Operations Division at theArmy Ballistic Missile Agency, submitted his finalProject Horizonplans to theU.S. Army. The overall goal of Horizon was to place men on the Moon, a mission that would soon be taken over by the rapidly forming NASA. Although concentrating on the Moon missions, von Braun also detailed an orbiting laboratory built out of a Horizon upper stage,an idea used for Skylab.A number of NASA centers studied various space station designs in the early 1960s. Studies generally looked at platforms launched by the Saturn V, followed up by crews launched on Saturn IB using anApollo command and service module,or aGemini capsuleon aTitan II-C, the latter being much less expensive in the case where cargo was not needed. Proposals ranged from an Apollo-based station with two to three men, or a small "canister" for four men with Gemini capsules resupplying it, to a large, rotating station with 24 men and an operating lifetime of about five years.A proposal to study the use of a Saturn S-IVB as a crewed space laboratory was documented in 1962 by theDouglas Aircraft Company. TheDepartment of Defense(DoD) and NASA cooperated closely in many areas of space.In September 1963, NASA and the DoD agreed to cooperate in building a space station.The DoD wanted its own crewed facility, however,and in December 1963 it announcedManned Orbital Laboratory(MOL), a small space station primarily intended for photo reconnaissance using large telescopes directed by a two-person crew. The station was the same diameter as aTitan II upper stage, and would be launched with the crew riding atop in a modified Gemini capsule with a hatch cut into theheat shieldon the bottom of the capsule.MOL competed for funding with a NASA station for the next five yearsand politicians and other officials often suggested that NASA participate in MOL or use the DoD design.The military project led to changes to the NASA plans so that they would resemble MOL less. NASA management was concerned about losing the 400,000 workers involved in Apollo after landing on the Moon in 1969.A reason von Braun, head of NASA'sMarshall Space Flight Centerduring the 1960s, advocated a smaller station after his large one was not built was that he wished to provide his employees with work beyond developing the Saturn rockets, which would be completed relatively early during Project Apollo.NASA set up the Apollo Logistic Support System Office, originally intended to study various ways to modify the Apollo hardware for scientific missions. The office initially proposed a number of projects for direct scientific study, including an extended-stay lunar mission which required two Saturn V launchers, a "lunar truck" based on theLunar Module(LM), a large, crewed solar telescope using an LM as its crew quarters, and small space stations using a variety of LM or CSM-based hardware. Although it did not look at the space station specifically, over the next two years the office became increasingly dedicated to this role. In August 1965, the office was renamed, becoming theApollo Applications Program(AAP). As part of their general work, in August 1964 theManned Spacecraft Center(MSC) presented studies on an expendable lab known asApollo X, short forApollo Extension System.Apollo Xwould have replaced the LM carried on the top of the S-IVB stage with a small space station slightly larger than the CSM's service area, containing supplies and experiments for missions between 15 and 45 days' duration. Using this study as a baseline, several mission profiles were looked at over the next six months. In November 1964, von Braun proposed a more ambitious plan to build a much larger station built from theS-IIsecond stage of a Saturn V. His design replaced the S-IVB third stage with an aeroshell, primarily as an adapter for the CSM on top. Inside the shell was a 10 feet (3.0 m) cylindrical equipment section. On reaching orbit, theS-IIsecond stage would be vented to remove any remaininghydrogenfuel, then the equipment section would be slid into it via a large inspection hatch. This became known as a "wet workshop" concept, because of the conversion of an active fuel tank. The station filled the entire interior of the S-II stage's hydrogen tank, with the equipment section forming a "spine" and living quarters located between it and the walls of the booster. This would have resulted in a very large 33 by 45 feet (10 by 14 m) living area. Power was to be provided bysolar cellslining the outside of the S-II stage. One problem with this proposal was that it required a dedicated Saturn V launch to fly the station. At the time the design was being proposed, it was not known how many of the then-contracted Saturn Vs would be required to achieve a successful Moon landing. However, several planned Earth-orbit test missions for the LM and CSM had been canceled, leaving some Saturn IBs free for use. Further work led to the idea of building a smaller "wet workshop" based on the S-IVB, launched as the second stage of a Saturn IB. A number of S-IVB-based stations were studied at MSC from mid-1965, which had much in common with the Skylab design that eventually flew. Anairlockwould be attached to the hydrogen tank, in the area designed to hold theLM, and a minimum amount of equipment would be installed in the tank in order to avoid taking up too much fuel volume. Floors of the station would be made from an open metal framework that allowed the fuel to flow through it. After launch, a follow-up mission launched by a Saturn IB would launch additional equipment, including solar panels, an equipment section and docking adapter, and various experiments.Douglas Aircraft Company, builder of the S-IVB stage, was asked to prepare proposals along these lines. The company had for several years been proposing stations based on the S-IV stage, before it was replaced by the S-IVB. On April 1, 1966, MSC sent out contracts to Douglas,Grumman, andMcDonnellfor the conversion of an S-IVB spent stage, under the name Saturn S-IVB spent-stage experiment support module (SSESM).In May 1966, astronauts voiced concerns over the purging of the stage's hydrogen tank in space. Nevertheless, in late July 1966, it was announced that the Orbital Workshop would be launched as a part of Apollo mission AS-209, originally one of the Earth-orbit CSM test launches, followed by two Saturn I/CSM crew launches, AAP-1 and AAP-2. The Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) remained AAP's chief competitor for funds, although the two programs cooperated on technology. NASA considered flying experiments on MOL or using itsTitan IIICbooster instead of the much more expensive Saturn IB. The agency decided that the Air Force station was not large enough and that converting Apollo hardware for use with Titan would be too slow and too expensive.The DoD canceled MOL in June 1969. Design work continued over the next two years, in an era of shrinking budgets.(NASA sought US$450 million for Apollo Applications in fiscal year 1967, for example, but received US$42 million.)In August 1967, the agency announced that the lunar mapping and base construction missions examined by the AAP were being canceled. Only the Earth-orbiting missions remained, namely theOrbital WorkshopandApollo Telescope Mountsolar observatory. The success ofApollo 8in December 1968, launched on the third flight of a Saturn V, made it likely that one would be available to launch a dry workshop.Later, several Moon missions were canceled as well, originally to beApollo missions 18 through 20. The cancellation of these missions freed up three Saturn V boosters for the AAP program. Although this would have allowed them to develop von Braun's original S-II-based mission, by this time so much work had been done on the S-IV-based design that work continued on this baseline. With the extra power available, the wet workshop was no longer needed;the S-IC and S-II lower stages could launch a "dry workshop", with its interior already prepared, directly into orbit. A dry workshop simplified plans for the interior of the station.Industrial design firmRaymond Loewy/William Snaith recommended emphasizing habitability and comfort for the astronauts by providing a wardroom for meals and relaxationand a window to view Earth and space, although astronauts were dubious about the designers' focus on details such as color schemes.Habitability had not previously been an area of concern when building spacecraft due to their small size and brief mission durations, but the Skylab missions would last for months.NASA sent a scientist onJacques Piccard'sBen Franklinsubmarine in theGulf Streamin July and August 1969 to learn how six people would live in an enclosed space for four weeks. Astronauts were uninterested in watching movies on a proposed entertainment center or in playing games, but they did want books and individual music choices.Food was also important; early Apollo crews complained about its quality, and a NASA volunteer found it intolerable to live on the Apollo food for four days on Earth. Its taste and composition were unpleasant, in the form of cubes and squeeze tubes.Skylab foodsignificantly improved on its predecessors by prioritizing palatability over scientific needs. Forsleeping in space, each astronaut had a private area the size of a smallwalk-in closet, with a curtain, sleeping bag, and locker.Designers also added a showerand atoiletfor comfort and to obtain precise urine and feces samples for examination on Earth.The waste samples were so important that they would have been priorities in anyrescue mission. Skylab did not have recycling systems such as the conversion of urine to drinking water; it also did not dispose of waste by dumping it into space. The S-IVB's 73,280 liters (16,120 imp gal; 19,360 U.S. gal)liquid oxygentank below the Orbital Work Shop was used to store trash and wastewater, passed through anairlock. On August 8, 1969, theMcDonnell Douglas Corporationreceived a contract for the conversion of two existing S-IVB stages to the Orbital Workshop configuration. One of the S-IV test stages was shipped to McDonnell Douglas for the construction of a mock-up in January 1970. The Orbital Workshop was renamed "Skylab" in February 1970 as a result of a NASA contest.The actual stage that flew was the upper stage of the AS-212 rocket (the S-IVB stage, S-IVB 212). The mission computer used aboard Skylab was theIBMSystem/4PiTC-1, a relative of theAP-101Space Shuttle computers. The Saturn V with serial number SA-513, originally produced for the Apollo program – before the cancellation of Apollo 18, 19, and 20 – was repurposed and redesigned to launch Skylab.The Saturn V's third stage was removed and replaced with Skylab, but with the controllinginstrument unitremaining in its standard position. Skylab was launched on May 14, 1973, by the modified Saturn V. The launch is sometimes referred to as Skylab 1. Severe damage was sustained during launch and deployment, including the loss of the station'smicrometeoroidshield/sun shade and one of its mainsolar panels. Debris from the lost micrometeoroid shield became tangled in the remaining solar panel, preventing its full deployment and thus leaving the station with a huge power deficit. Immediately following Skylab's launch,Pad 39AatKennedy Space Centerwas deactivated, and construction proceeded to modify it for the Space Shuttle program, originally targetinga maiden launch in March 1979. The crewed missions to Skylab would occur using a Saturn IB rocket from Launch Pad 39B. Skylab 1 was the last uncrewed launch from LC-39A until February 19, 2017, whenSpaceX CRS-10was launched from there. Three crewed missions,designatedSkylab 2,Skylab 3, andSkylab 4, were made to Skylab inApollo command and service modules. The first crewed mission, Skylab 2, was launched on May 25, 1973, by a Saturn IB and involved extensive repairs to the station. The crew deployed a parasol-like sunshade through a small instrument port from the inside of the station, bringing station temperatures down to acceptable levels and preventing overheating that would have melted the plastic insulation inside the station and released poisonous gases. This solution was designed byJack Kinzler, who won theNASA Distinguished Service Medalfor his efforts. The crew conducted further repairs via twospacewalks(extravehicular activityor EVA). The crew stayed in orbit with Skylab for 28 days. Two additional missions followed, with the launch dates of July 28, 1973, (Skylab 3) and November 16, 1973, (Skylab 4), and mission durations of 59 and 84 days, respectively. The last Skylab crew returned to Earth on February 8, 1974. In addition to the three crewed missions, there was a rescue mission on standby that had a crew of two, but could take five back down. Also of note was the three-man crew ofSkylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test(SMEAT), who spent 56 days in 1972 at low-pressure on Earth to evaluate medical experiment equipment.This was a spaceflight analog test in full gravity, but Skylab hardware was tested and medical knowledge was gained. Originally intended to be visited by one 28–day and two 56–day missions for a total of 140 days,Skylab was ultimately occupied for 171 days and 13 hours during its three crewed expeditions, orbiting the Earth 2,476 times. Each of these extended the human record of 23 days for amount of time spent in space set by the SovietSoyuz 11crew aboard the space stationSalyut 1on June 30, 1971. Skylab 2 lasted 28 days, Skylab 3 –  56 days, and Skylab 4 –  84 days. Astronauts performed ten spacewalks, totaling 42 hours and 16 minutes. Skylab logged about 2,000 hours of scientific and medical experiments, 127,000 frames of film of theSunand 46,000 of Earth.Solar experiments included photographs of eightsolar flaresand produced valuable resultsthat scientists stated would have been impossible to obtain with uncrewed spacecraft.The existence of the Sun'scoronal holeswas confirmed because of these efforts.Many of the experiments conducted investigated the astronauts' adaptation to extended periods ofmicrogravity. A typical day began at 6 a.m.Central Time Zone.Although the toilet was small and noisy, both veteran astronauts –  who had endured earlier missions' rudimentary waste-collection systems –  and rookies complimented it.The first crew enjoyed taking a shower once a week, but found drying themselves in weightlessnessand vacuuming excess water difficult; later crews usually cleaned themselves daily with wet washcloths instead of using the shower. Astronauts also found that bending over in weightlessness to put on socks or tie shoelaces strained their abdominal muscles. Breakfast began at 7 a.m. Astronauts usually stood to eat, as sitting in microgravity also strained their abdominal muscles. They reported that their food –  although greatly improved from Apollo –  was bland and repetitive, and weightlessness caused utensils, food containers, and bits of food to float away; also, gas in their drinking water contributed toflatulence. After breakfast and preparation for lunch, experiments, tests and repairs of spacecraft systems and, if possible, 90 minutes of physical exercise followed; the station had a bicycle and other equipment, and astronauts could jog around the water tank. After dinner, which was scheduled for 6 p.m., crews performed household chores and prepared for the next day's experiments. Following lengthy daily instructions (some of which were up to 15 meters long) sent viateleprinter, the crews were often busy enough to postpone sleep.The station offered what a later study called "a highly satisfactory living and working environment for crews", with enough room for personal privacy.Although it had adart set,playing cards, and other recreational equipment in addition to books and music players, the window with its view of Earth became the most popular way to relax in orbit. Prior to departure about 80 experiments were named, although they are also described as "almost 300 separate investigations". Experiments were divided into six broad categories: Because the solar scientific airlock – one of two research airlocks – was unexpectedly occupied by the "parasol" that replaced the missing meteorite shield, a few experiments were instead installed outside with the telescopes during spacewalks or shifted to the Earth-facing scientific airlock. Skylab 2 spent less time than planned on most experiments due to station repairs. On the other hand, Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 far exceeded the initial experiment plans, once the crews adjusted to the environment and established comfortable working relationships with ground control. The figure (below) lists an overview of most major experiments.Skylab 4 carried out several more experiments, such as to observeComet Kohoutek. As a technology demonstration, the crew practiced flying theAutomatically Stabilized Maneuvering Unit (ASMU)inside the spacious dome of the Orbital Workshop. Designed to enable astronauts to perform untethered movements in microgravity.The ASMU tests established key piloting characteristics and capability base for theMMUsystems used on theSpace Shuttlemissions. Riccardo Giacconishared the 2002Nobel Prize in Physicsfor his study ofX-ray astronomy, including the study of emissions from the Sun onboard Skylab, contributing to the birth ofX-ray astronomy. Skylab had certain features to protect vulnerable technology fromradiation.The window was vulnerable to darkening, and this darkening could affect experiment S190.As a result, a light shield that could be open or shut was designed and installed on Skylab.To protect a wide variety of films, used for a variety of experiments and for astronautphotography, there were five film vaults.There were four smaller film vaults in theMultiple Docking Adapter, mainly because the structure could not carry enough weight for a single larger film vault.The orbital workshop could handle a single larger safe, which is also more efficient for shielding.A later example of a radiation vault is theJuno Radiation Vaultfor theJunoJupiter orbiter, launched in 2011, which was designed to protect much of the uncrewed spacecraft's electronics, using 1 cm thick walls oftitanium. The large vault in the orbital workshop had an empty mass of 2,398 pounds (1,088 kg).The four smaller vaults had combined mass of 1,545 lb (701 kg).The primary construction material of all five safes was aluminum.When Skylab re-entered there was one 180 pounds (82 kg) chunk of aluminum found that was thought to be a door to one of the film vaults.The large film vault was one of the heaviest single pieces of Skylab tore-enterEarth's atmosphere. The Skylab film vault was used for storing film from various sources including theApollo Telescope Mountsolar instruments.Six ATM experiments used film to record data, and over the course of the missions over 150,000 successful exposures were recorded.The film canister had to be manually retrieved on crewed spacewalks to the instruments during the missions.The film canisters were returned to Earth aboard the Apollo capsules when each mission ended, and were among the heaviest items that had to be returned at the end of each mission.The heaviest canisters weighed 40 kg and could hold up to 16,000 frames of film. There were two types ofgyroscopeson Skylab.Control-moment gyroscopes(CMG) could physically move the station, and rate gyroscopes measured the rate of rotation to find its orientation.The CMG helped provide the fine pointing needed by the Apollo Telescope Mount, and to resist various forces that can change the station's orientation. Some of the forces acting on Skylab that the pointing system needed to resist: The Skylab-Aattitude and pointing controlsystem has been developed to meet the high accuracy requirements established by the desired experiment conditions. Conditions must be maintained by the control system under the influence of external and internal disturbance torques, such as gravity gradient and aerodynamic disturbances and onboard astronaut motion. —Skylab Attitude and Pointing Control System(NASA Technical Note D-6068)This article incorporates text from this source, which is in thepublic domain. Skylab was the first large spacecraft to use big gyroscopes, capable of controlling its attitude.The control could also be used to help point the instruments.The gyroscopes took about ten hours to get spun up if they were turned off.There was also a thruster system to control Skylab's attitude.There were 9 rate-gyroscope sensors, 3 for each axis.These were sensors that fed their output to the Skylab digital computer.Two of three were active and their input was averaged, while the third was a backup.From NASA SP-400Skylab, Our First Space Station, "each Skylab control-moment gyroscope consisted of a motor-driven rotor, electronics assembly, and power inverter assembly. The 21-inch-diameter (530 mm) rotor weighed 155 pounds (70 kg) and rotated at approximately 8950 revolutions per minute". There were three control moment gyroscopes on Skylab, but only two were required to maintain pointing.The control and sensor gyroscopes were part of a system that help detect and control the orientation of the station in space.Other sensors that helped with this were aSun trackerand astar tracker.The sensors fed data to the main computer, which could then use the control gyroscopes and or the thruster system to keep Skylab pointed as desired. Skylab had a zero-gravity shower system in the work and experiment section of the Orbital Workshopdesigned and built at theManned Spaceflight Center.It had a cylindrical curtain that went from floor to ceiling and a vacuum system to suck away water.The floor of the shower had foot restraints. To bathe, the user coupled a pressurized bottle of warmed water to the shower's plumbing, then stepped inside and secured the curtain. A push-button shower nozzle was connected by a stiff hose to the top of the shower.The system was designed for about 6 pints (2.8 liters) of water per shower,the water being drawn from the personal hygiene water tank.The use of both the liquid soap and water was carefully planned out, with enough soap and warm water for one shower per week per person. The first astronaut to use the space shower wasPaul J. Weitzon Skylab 2, the first crewed mission.He said, "It took a fair amount longer to use than you might expect, but you come out smelling good".A Skylab shower took about two and a half hours, including the time to set up the shower and dissipate used water.The procedure for operating the shower was as follows: One of the big concerns with bathing in space was control of droplets of water so that they did not cause an electrical short by floating into the wrong area.The vacuum water system was thus integral to the shower. The vacuum fed to a centrifugal separator, filter, and collection bag to allow the system to vacuum up the fluids.Waste water was injected into a disposal bag which was in turn put in the waste tank.The material for the shower enclosure was fire-proofbeta clothwrapped around hoops of 43 inches (1,100 mm) diameter; the top hoop was connected to the ceiling.The shower could be collapsed to the floor when not in use.Skylab also supplied astronauts with rayon terrycloth towels which had a color-coded stitching for each crew-member.There were 420 towels on board Skylab initially. A simulated Skylab shower was also used during the 56-day SMEAT simulation; the crew used the shower after exercise and found it a positive experience. There was a variety of hand-held and fixed experiments that used various types of film. In addition to the instruments in the ATM solar observatory, 35 and 70 mm film cameras were carried on board. An analog TV camera was carried that recorded video electronically. These electronic signals could be recorded to magnetic tape or be transmitted to Earth by radio signal. It was determined that film would fog up due to radiation over the course of the mission.To prevent this, film was stored in vaults. Personal (hand-held) camera equipment: Film for the DAC was contained in DAC film magazines, which contained up to 140 feet (43 m) of film.At 24 frames per second this was enough for 4 minutes of filming, with progressively longer film times with lower frame rates such as 16 minutes at 6 frames per second.The film had to be loaded or unloaded from the DAC in a photographicdark room. Experiment S190B was the Actron Earth Terrain Camera. The S190A was theMultispectral Photographic Camera: There was also aPolaroid SX-70instant camera,and a pair ofLeitzTrinovid 10 × 40 binoculars modified for use in space to aid in Earth observations. The SX-70 was used to take pictures of theExtreme Ultravioletmonitor by Dr. Garriot, as the monitor provided a live video feed of the solar corona in ultraviolet light as observed by Skylab solar observatory instruments located in theApollo Telescope Mount. Skylab was controlled in part by a digital computer system, and one of its main jobs was to control the pointing of the station; pointing was especially important for its solar power collection and observatory functions.The computer consisted of two actual computers, a primary and a secondary. The system ran several thousand words of code, which was also backed up on the Memory Load Unit (MLU).The two computers were linked to each other and various input and output items by the workshop computer interface.Operations could be switched from the primary to the backup, which were the same design, either automatically if errors were detected, by the Skylab crew, or from the ground. The Skylab computer was a space-hardened and customized version of the TC-1 computer, a version of theIBM System/4 Pi, itself based on theSystem 360computer.The TC-1 had a 16,000-word memory based on ferrite memory cores, while the MLU was a read-onlytape drivethat contained a backup of the main computer programs.The tape drive would take 11 seconds to upload the backup of the software program to a main computer.The TC-1 used 16-bit words and thecentral processorcame from the 4Pi computer.There was a 16k and an 8k version of the software program. The computer had a mass of 100 pounds (45 kg), and consumed about ten percent of the station'selectrical power. After launch the computer is what the controllers on the ground communicated with to control the station's orientation.When the sun-shield was torn off the ground staff had to balance solar heating with electrical production.On March 6, 1978, the computer system was re-activated by NASA to control the re-entry. The system had a user interface that consisted of a display, ten buttons, and a three-position switch.Because the numbers were inoctal(base-8), it only had numbers zero to seven (8 keys), and the other two keys were enter and clear.The display could show minutes and seconds which would count down to orbital benchmarks, or it could display keystrokes when using the interface.The interface could be used to change the software program.The user interface was called the Digital Address System (DAS) and could send commands to the computer's command system. The command system could also get commands from the ground. For personal computing needs Skylab crews were equipped with models of the then new hand-held electronic scientific calculator, which was used in place of slide-rules used on prior space missions as the primary personal computer. The model used was theHewlett Packard HP 35.Some slide rules continued in use aboard Skylab, and acircular slide rulewas at the workstation. Calculations made during the mission, based on current values for solar activity and expected atmospheric density, gave the workshop just over nine years in orbit. Slowly at first – dropping 30 kilometers by 1980 – and then faster – another 100 kilometers by the end of 1982 – Skylab would come down, and some time around March 1983 it would burn up in the dense atmosphere. After nearly 172 days, Skylab considerably exceeded its planned 140 day habitation. The station had held up relatively well, but its onboard supplies were low and its systems were beginning to degrade. One of the three control-moment gyroscopes (CMGs) failed 8 days into Skylab 4,and by the end of the mission another was showing signs of impending failure.With just a single CMG Skylab would be unable to control its attitude, and it was not possible to repair or replace one of the broken gyroscopes on-orbit. Virtually all of the prepackaged food launched with the station had been consumed, Skylab 4's mission extension from 56 to 84 days required the crew take an extra 28 days worth of food with them,but there was still enough water to support three men for 60 days, and enough oxygen/nitrogen to support the same for 140 days. A fourth crewed mission using an Apollo CSM was considered, which would have used the launch vehicle kept on standby for the Skylab Rescue mission. This would have been a 20-day mission to boost Skylab to a higher altitude and do more scientific experiments.Another plan was to use aTeleoperator Retrieval System(TRS) launched aboard the Space Shuttle (then under development), to robotically re-boost the orbit. When Skylab 5 was cancelled, it was expected Skylab would stay in orbit until the 1980s, which was enough time to overlap with the beginning of Shuttle launches. Other options for launching TRS included theTitan IIIandAtlas-Agena. No option received the level of effort and funding needed for execution before Skylab's sooner-than-expected re-entry. The Skylab 4 crew left a bag filled with supplies to welcome visitors, and left the hatch unlocked.Skylab's internal systems were evaluated and tested from the ground, and effort was put into plans for re-using it, as late as 1978.NASA discouraged any discussion of additional visits due to the station's age,but in 1977 and 1978, when the agency still believed the Space Shuttle would be ready by 1979, it completed two studies on reusing the station.By September 1978, the agency believed Skylab was safe for crews, with all major systems intact and operational.It still had 180man-daysof water and 420-man-days of oxygen, and astronauts could refill both;the station could hold up to about 600 to 700 man-days of drinkable water and 420 man-days of food.Before Skylab 4 left they did one more boost, running the Skylab thrusters for 3 minutes which added 11 km in height to its orbit. Skylab was left in a 433 by 455 km orbit on departure. At this time, the NASA-accepted estimate for its re-entry was nine years. The studies cited several benefits from reusing Skylab, which one called a resource worth "hundreds of millions of dollars"with "unique habitability provisions for long duration space flight".Because no more operational Saturn V rockets were available after the Apollo program, four to five shuttle flights and extensivespace architecturewould have been needed to build another station as large as Skylab's 12,400 cubic feet (350 m3) volume.Its ample size – much greater than that of the shuttle alone, or even the shuttle plusSpacelab– was enough, with some modifications, for up to seven astronautsof both sexes,and experiments needing a long duration in space;even a movie projector for recreation was possible. Proponents of Skylab's reuse also said repairing and upgrading Skylab would provide information on the results of long-duration exposure to space for future stations.The most serious issue for reactivation wasattitude control, as one of the station's gyroscopes had failedand the attitude control system needed refueling; these issues would need EVA to fix or replace. The station had not been designed for extensive resupply. However, although it was originally planned that Skylab crews would only perform limited maintenance,they successfully made major repairs during EVA, such as the Skylab 2 crew's deployment of thesolar paneland the Skylab 4 crew's repair of the primary coolant loop.The Skylab 2 crew fixed one item during EVA by, reportedly, "hit[ting] it with [a] hammer". Some studies also said, beyond the opportunity for space construction and maintenance experience, reactivating the station would free up shuttle flights for other uses,and reduce the need tomodify the shuttle for long-duration missions.Even if the station were not crewed again, went one argument, it might serve as an experimental platform. The reactivation would likely have occurred in four phases: The first three phases would have required about US$60 million in 1980s dollars, not including launch costs. Other options for launching TRS wereTitan IIIorAtlas-Agena. After a boost of 6.8 miles (10.9 km) by Skylab 4's Apollo CSM before its departure in 1974, Skylab was left in aparking orbitof 269 miles (433 km) by 283 miles (455 km)that was expected to last until at least the early 1980s, based on estimates of the 11-yearsunspot cyclethat began in 1976.In 1962, NASA first considered the potential risks of a space station reentry, but decided not to incorporate aretrorocketsystem in Skylab due to cost and acceptable risk. The spent 49-ton Saturn VS-IIstage which had launched Skylab in 1973 remained in orbit for almost two years, and made a controlled reentry on January 11, 1975.The second stage's reentry was mistimed however and deorbited slightly earlier in the orbit than planned. British mathematicianDesmond King-Heleof theRoyal Aircraft Establishment(RAE) predicted in 1973 that Skylab would de-orbit and crash to Earth in 1979, sooner than NASA's forecast, because of increasedsolar activity.Greater-than-expected solar activityheated the outer layers of Earth's atmosphere and increased drag on Skylab. By late 1977,NORADalso forecast a reentry in mid-1979;aNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA) scientist criticized NASA for using an inaccurate model for the second most-intense sunspot cycle in a century, and for ignoring NOAA predictions published in 1976. The reentry of the USSR's nuclear poweredCosmos 954in January 1978, and the resulting radioactive debris fall innorthern Canada, drew more attention to Skylab's orbit. Although Skylab did not contain radioactive materials, theState Departmentwarned NASA about the potential diplomatic repercussions of station debris.Battelle Memorial Instituteforecast that up to 25 tons of metal debris could land in 500 pieces over an area 4,000 miles (6,400 km) long and 1,000 miles (1,600 km) wide. The lead-lined film vault, for example, might land intact at 400 feet per second (120 m/s). Ground controllers re-established contact with Skylab in March 1978and recharged its batteries.Although NASA worked on plans to reboost Skylab with the Space Shuttle through 1978 and theTRSwas almost complete, the agency gave up in December 1978 when it became clear that the shuttle would not be ready in time;its first flight,STS-1, did not occur until April 1981. Also rejected were proposals to launch the TRS using one or two uncrewed rocketsor to attempt to destroy the station with missiles. Skylab's impending demise in 1979 was an international media event,with T-shirts and hats with bullseyesand "Skylab Repellent" with a money-back guarantee,wagering on the time and place of re-entry, and nightly news reports. TheSan Francisco Examineroffered a US$10,000 prize (equivalent to $43,000 today)for the first piece of Skylab delivered to its offices; the rivalSan Francisco Chronicleoffered US$200,000 ($866,000 today)if a subscriber suffered personal or property damage.A Nebraska neighborhood painted a target so that the station would have "something to aim for", a resident said. TheExaminercreated the prize to compete with theChronicleand its popular columnistHerb Caen. PublisherReg Murphywas reluctant to pay the money,Jeff Jarvisrecalled, but NASA assured Jarvis—Caen's counterpart at theExaminer—that the station would not hit land.A report commissioned by NASA calculated that the odds were 1 in 152 of debris hitting any human, and odds of 1 in 7 of debris hitting a city of 100,000 people or more.Special teams were readied to head to any country hit by debris.The event caused so much panic in thePhilippinesthat PresidentFerdinand Marcosappeared on national television to reassure the public. A week before re-entry, NASA forecast that it would occur between July 10 and 14, with the 12th the most likely date, and theRoyal Aircraft Establishment(RAE) predicted the 14th.In the hours before the event, ground controllers adjusted Skylab's orientation to minimize the risk of re-entry on a populated area.They aimed the station at a spot 810 miles (1,300 km) south-southeast ofCape Town, South Africa, and re-entry began at approximately 16:37 UTC, July 11, 1979.The station did not burn up as fast as NASA expected. Debris landed about 300 miles (480 km) east ofPerth, Western Australia due to a four-percent calculation error,and was found betweenEsperance, Western AustraliaandRawlinna, from 31° to 34° S and 122° to 126° E, about 130–150 km (81–93 mi) radius aroundBalladonia, Western Australia. Residents and an airline pilot saw dozens of colorful flares as large pieces broke up in the atmosphere;the debris landed in an almost unpopulated area, but the sightings still caused NASA to fear human injury or property damage. Don Lind, in a 2005 interview, reports no human injuries or deaths. Stan Thornton found 24 pieces of Skylab at his home in Esperance. After obtaining his first passport, Thornton flew toSan Francisco. After waiting one week for Marshall Space Flight Center to authenticate the wreckage, he collected theExaminerprize and another US$1,000 from a Philadelphia businessman who had flown Thornton's family and girlfriend there.Analysis of the debris showed that the station had disintegrated 10 miles (16 km) above the Earth, much lower than expected. TheShire of Esperancelight-heartedly fined NASA A$400 forlittering,and while the fine was indeedwritten offthree months later, it was nonetheless eventually paid on behalf of NASA in April 2009, after Scott Barley of Highway Radio raised the funds from his morning show listeners. After the demise of Skylab, NASA focused on the reusableSpacelabmodule, an orbital workshop that could be deployed with the Space Shuttle and returned to Earth. The next American major space station project wasSpace Station Freedom, which was merged into the International Space Station in 1993 and launched starting in 1998.Shuttle-Mirwas another project and led to the US fundingSpektr,Priroda, and theMir Docking Modulein the 1990s. Launch vehicles: In 1971, before Skylab launched, NASA studied the potential of adding another mission to the three already planned. Called Skylab Revisit, two options were examined. First was an open ended mission that would launch within 30 days after Skylab 4, aiming to last 56 days. The second would visit the station a year after the last crew had left to determine the health and habitability of the station after two years in space. Neither option was rated highly. The first option's chance of mission success was considered uncertain at best, and the second's even worse given the expected dearth of food, water, and oxygen supplies and the degraded condition of Skylab's system after two years in orbit. There was aSkylab Rescuemission assembled for the second crewed mission to Skylab, but it was not needed. Another rescue mission was assembled for the last Skylab and was also on standby for ASTP. These missions used a backup Saturn IB rocket (SA-209) and CSM module (CSM-119). Skylab 5 would have been a short 20-day mission in April 1974 to conduct more scientific experiments and use the Apollo'sService Propulsion Systemengine to boost Skylab into a higher orbit, supporting later station use by the Space Shuttle. Vance Brand(commander),William B. Lenoir(science pilot), andDon Lind(pilot) would have been the crew for this mission, with Brand and Lind being the prime crew for the Skylab Rescue flights.Brand and Lind also trained for a mission that would have aimed Skylab for a controlleddeorbit. Skylab 5 would have used the SA-209 rocket and CMS-119 on standby for Skylab Rescue. Upon its cancellation the rocket was put on display at NASA Kennedy Space Center. In addition to the flown Skylab space station, a secondflight-quality backupSkylab space station had been built during the program. NASA considered using it for a second station in May 1973 or later, to be calledSkylab B(S-IVB 515), but decided against it. Launching another Skylab with another Saturn V rocket would have been very costly, and it was decided to spend this money on the development of the Space Shuttle instead. NASA transferred Skylab B to theNational Air and Space Museumin 1975. On display in the museum's Space Hall since 1976, the orbital workshop has been slightly modified to permit viewers to walk through the living quarters. A full-size 1G training mock-up once used for astronaut training is located at theLyndon B. Johnson Space Centervisitor centerinHouston,Texas. Another training mockup, originally used at theNeutral Buoyancy Simulator(NBS), is at theU.S. Space & Rocket CenterinHuntsville, Alabama. Originally displayed indoors, it was subsequently stored outdoors for several years to make room for other exhibits. To mark the 40th anniversary of the Skylab program, the Orbital Workshop portion of the trainer was restored and moved into theDavidson Centerin 2013. The numerical identification of the crewed Skylab missions was the cause of some confusion. Originally, the uncrewed launch of Skylab and the three crewed missions to the station were numberedSL-1throughSL-4. During the preparations for the crewed missions, some documentation was created with a different scheme –SLM-1throughSLM-3– for those missions only.William PoguecreditsPete Conradwith asking the Skylab program director which scheme should be used for themission patches, and the astronauts were told to use 1–2–3, not 2–3–4. By the time NASA administrators tried to reverse this decision, it was too late, as all the in-flight clothing had already been manufactured and shipped with the 1–2–3 mission patches. L.B. James of NASA Marshall predicted in 1970 that an astronomer, medical doctor, and third scientist might compose each Skylab crew.NASA Astronaut Group 4andNASA Astronaut Group 6were scientists recruited as astronauts. They and the scientific community hoped to have two on each Skylab mission, butDeke Slayton, director of flight crew operations, insisted that two trained pilots fly on each.Although the scientists were qualified jet pilots, NASA headquarters made the final decision of one scientist in each Skylab crew on 6 July 1971, after the deaths of three cosmonauts on Soyuz 11. Kerwin was the first Skylab scientist-astronaut. NASA chose a medical doctor to better understand theeffect of spaceflight on the human bodyon a long-duration mission. Astronauts trained for minor medical procedures at a Houston hospitalemergency department. TheSkylab Medical Experiment Altitude Testor SMEAT was a 56-day (8-week) Earth analog Skylab test.The test had a low-pressure high oxygen-percentage atmosphere but it operated under full gravity, as SMEAT was not in orbit. The test had a three-astronaut crew with CommanderRobert Crippen, PilotKarol J. Bobko, and Science PilotWilliam E. Thornton;there was a focus on medical studies and Thornton was an M.D.The crew lived and worked in the pressure chamber, converted to be like Skylab, from July 26 to September 20, 1972. From 1966 to 1974, the Skylab program cost a total of US$2.2 billion, (equivalent to $17 billion in 2024). As its three three-person crews spent 510 total man-days in space, each man-day cost approximately US$20 million, compared to US$7.5 million for theInternational Space Station. A minor storyline of the 1986 filmDogs in Spaceis an attempt by characters of theMelbournehousehold to fabricate pieces of Skylab and win a radio station's competition to locate debris from the space station as it fell to earth in Australia. The documentarySearching for Skylabwas released online in March 2019. It was written and directed by Dwight Steven-Boniecki and was partlycrowdfunded. Thealternate historyApple TV+ original seriesFor All Mankind(2019) depicts the use of the space station in the first episode of the second season, surviving to the 1980s and coexisting with theSpace Shuttleprogram in the alternate timeline. In the 2011 filmSkylab, a family gathers in France and waits for the station to fall out of orbit. It was directed by Julie Delpy. The 2021 Indian filmSkylabdepicts fictitious incidents in aTelanganavillage preceding the disintegration of the space station. The 2024 seriesLast Days of the Space Ageis set in 1979Western Australia, during Skylab's reentry near Perth.

TheNational Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA/ˈnæsə/) is anindependent agencyof theUS federal governmentresponsible for the United States' civilspace programand for research inaeronauticsandspaceexploration. Headquartered inWashington, D.C., NASA operates ten field centers across the United States and is organized into mission directorates for Science, Space Operations, Exploration Systems Development, Space Technology,Aeronautics Research, and Mission Support.Established in 1958, NASA succeeded theNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics(NACA) to give the American space development effort a distinct civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications inspace science. It has since led most of America'sspace explorationprograms, includingProject Mercury,Project Gemini, the 1968–1972Apollo programmissions, theSkylabspace station, and theSpace Shuttle. The agency maintains major ground and communications infrastructure including theDeep Space Networkand the Near Space Network. NASA's science division is focused on better understanding Earth through theEarth Observing System; advancingheliophysicsthrough the efforts of theScience Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program; exploring bodies throughout theSolar Systemwith advancedrobotic spacecraftsuch asNew Horizonsandplanetary roverssuch asPerseverance; and researchingastrophysicstopics, such as theBig Bang, through theJames Webb Space Telescope, the fourGreat Observatories(including theHubble Space Telescope), and associated programs. TheLaunch Services Programoversees launch operations for itsuncrewed launches. NASA supports theInternational Space Station(ISS) along with theCommercial Crew Programand oversees the development of theOrion spacecraftand theSpace Launch Systemfor the lunarArtemis program. It maintains programmatic partnerships with agencies such asESA,JAXA,CSA,Roscosmos(for ISS operations),NOAA, and theUSGS. NASA’s missions and media operations—such asNASA TV,Astronomy Picture of the Day, and theNASA+streaming service—have maintained high public visibility and contributed to spaceflight outreach in the United States and abroad. A subject ofnumerous major films, NASA has maintained an influence on American popular culture since theApollo 11 missionin 1969. For FY2022, Congress authorized a $24.041 billion budget, with a civil-service workforce of roughly 18,400; as of 2025, the acting administrator isSean Duffy. NASA traces its roots to theNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics(NACA). DespiteDayton, Ohio being the birthplace of aviation, by 1914 the United States recognized that it was far behind Europe in aviation capability. Determined to regain American leadership in aviation, theUnited States Congresscreated theAviation Sectionof the US Army Signal Corps in 1914 and established NACA in 1915 to foster aeronautical research and development. Over the next forty years, NACA would conduct aeronautical research in support of theUS Air Force,US Army,US Navy, and the civil aviation sector. After the end ofWorld War II, NACA became interested in the possibilities of guided missiles and supersonic aircraft, developing and testing theBell X-1in a joint program with theUS Air Force. NACA's interest in space grew out of its rocketry program at the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division. The Soviet Union's launch ofSputnik 1ushered in theSpace Ageand kicked off theSpace Race. Despite NACA's early rocketry program, the responsibility for launching the first American satellite fell to theNaval Research Laboratory'sProject Vanguard, whose operational issues ensured theArmy Ballistic Missile Agencywould launchExplorer 1, America's first satellite, on February 1, 1958. TheEisenhower Administrationdecided to split the United States's military and civil spaceflight programs, which were organized together under theDepartment of Defense'sAdvanced Research Projects Agency. NASA was established on July 29, 1958, with the signing of theNational Aeronautics and Space Actand it began operations on October 1, 1958. As the American's premier aeronautics agency, NACA formed the core of NASA's new structure by reassigning 8,000 employees and three major research laboratories. NASA also proceeded to absorb the Naval Research Laboratory's Project Vanguard, the Army'sJet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL), and theArmy Ballistic Missile AgencyunderWernher von Braun. This left NASA firmly as the United States's civil space lead and the Air Force as the military space lead. Plans for human spaceflight began in the US Armed Forces prior to NASA's creation. The Air Force'sMan in Space Soonestproject formed in 1956,coupled with the Army's Project Adam, served as the foundation forProject Mercury. NASA established theSpace Task Groupto manage the program,which would conduct crewed sub-orbital flights with the Army'sRedstonerockets and orbital flights with the Air Force'sAtlaslaunch vehicles. While NASA intended for its first astronauts to be civilians, President Eisenhower directed that they be selected from the military. TheMercury 7astronauts included three Air Force pilots, three Navy aviators, and one Marine Corps pilot. On May 5, 1961,Alan Shepardbecame the first American to enter space, performing a suborbital spaceflight in theFreedom 7.This flight occurred less than a month after the SovietYuri Gagarinbecame the first human in space, executing a full orbital spaceflight. NASA's first orbital spaceflight was conducted byJohn Glennon February 20, 1962, in theFriendship 7, making three full orbits before reentering. Glenn had to fly parts of his final two orbits manually due to an autopilot malfunction.The sixth and final Mercury mission was flown byGordon Cooperin May 1963, performing 22 orbits over 34 hours in theFaith 7.The Mercury Program was wildly recognized as a resounding success, achieving its objectives to orbit a human in space, develop tracking and control systems, and identify other issues associated with human spaceflight. While much of NASA's attention turned to space, it did not put aside its aeronautics mission. Early aeronautics research attempted to build upon the X-1'ssupersonic flightto build an aircraft capable ofhypersonic flight. TheNorth American X-15was a joint NASA–US Air Force program,with the hypersonic test aircraft becoming the first non-dedicated spacecraft to cross from the atmosphere to outer space. The X-15 also served as a testbed for Apollo program technologies, as well asramjetandscramjetpropulsion. Escalations in theCold Warbetween the United States and Soviet Union prompted PresidentJohn F. Kennedyto charge NASA with landing an American on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth by the end of the 1960s and installedJames E. Webbas NASA administrator to achieve this goal.On May25, 1961, President Kennedy openly declared this goal in his "Urgent National Needs" speech to the United States Congress, declaring: I believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. Kennedy gave his "We choose to go to the Moon" speech the next year, on September12, 1962 atRice University, where he addressed the nation hoping to reinforce public support for the Apollo program. Despite attacks on the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon from the former president Dwight Eisenhower and 1964 presidential candidateBarry Goldwater, President Kennedy was able to protect NASA's growing budget, of which 50% went directly to human spaceflight and it was later estimated that, at its height, 5% of Americans worked on some aspect of the Apollo program. Mirroring the Department of Defense's program management concept using redundant systems in building the first intercontinental ballistic missiles, NASA requested the Air Force assign Major GeneralSamuel C. Phillipsto the space agency where he would serve as the director of the Apollo program. Development of theSaturnVrocket was led by Wernher von Braun and his team at theMarshall Space Flight Center, derived from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's originalSaturnI. TheApollo spacecraftwas designed and built byNorth American Aviation, while theApollo Lunar Modulewas designed and built byGrumman. To develop the spaceflight skills and equipment required for a lunar mission, NASA initiatedProject Gemini.Using a modified Air ForceTitanIIlaunch vehicle, the Gemini capsule could hold two astronauts for flights of over two weeks. Gemini pioneered the use offuel cellsinstead of batteries, and conducted the first Americanspacewalksandrendezvous operations. TheRanger Programwas started in the 1950s as a response to Soviet lunar exploration, however most missions ended in failure. TheLunar Orbiter programhad greater success, mapping the surface in preparation for Apollo landings, conducting meteoroid detection, and measuring radiation levels. TheSurveyor programconducted uncrewed lunar landings and takeoffs, as well as taking surface and regolith observations.Despite the setback caused by theApollo1fire, which killed three astronauts, the program proceeded. Apollo8was the first crewedspacecraftto leavelow Earth orbitand the firsthuman spaceflightto reach theMoon. The crew orbited the Moon ten times on December24 and25, 1968, and then traveled safely back toEarth.The three Apollo8 astronauts—Frank Borman,James Lovell, andWilliam Anders—were the first humans to see the Earth as a globe in space, the first to witness anEarthrise, and the first to see and manually photograph the far side of the Moon. The first lunar landing was conducted by Apollo11. Commanded byNeil Armstrongwith astronautsBuzz AldrinandMichael Collins, Apollo11 was one of the most significant missions in NASA's history, marking the end of theSpace Racewhen theSoviet Uniongave up its lunar ambitions. As the first human to step on the surface of the Moon, Neil Armstrong uttered the now famous words: That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. NASA would conduct six total lunar landings as part of the Apollo program, withApollo17concluding the program in 1972. Wernher von Braun had advocated for NASA to develop a space station since the agency was created. In 1973, following the end of the Apollo lunar missions, NASA launched its first space station,Skylab, on the final launch of the SaturnV. Skylab reused a significant amount of Apollo and Saturn hardware, with a repurposed SaturnV third stage serving as the primary module for the space station. Damage to Skylab during its launch required spacewalks to be performed by the first crew to make it habitable and operational. Skylab hosted nine missions and was decommissioned in 1974 and deorbited in 1979, two years prior to the first launch of theSpace Shuttleand any possibility of boosting its orbit. In 1975, theApollo–Soyuzmission was the first ever international spaceflight and a major diplomatic accomplishment between the Cold War rivals, which also marked the last flight of the Apollo capsule.Flown in 1975, a US Apollo spacecraft docked with a SovietSoyuzcapsule. During the 1960s, NASA started itsspace scienceand interplanetary probe program. TheMariner programwas its flagship program, launching probes toVenus,Mars, andMercuryin the 1960s.The Jet Propulsion Laboratory was the lead NASA center for robotic interplanetary exploration, making significant discoveries about theinner planets. Despite these successes, Congress was unwilling to fund further interplanetary missions and NASA Administrator James Webb suspended all future interplanetary probes to focus resources on the Apollo program. Following the conclusion of the Apollo program, NASA resumed launching interplanetary probes and expanded itsspace scienceprogram. The first planet tagged for exploration wasVenus, sharing many similar characteristics to Earth. First visited by AmericanMariner 2spacecraft,Venus was observed to be a hot and inhospitable planet. Follow-on missions included thePioneer Venus projectin the 1970s andMagellan, which performed radar mapping of Venus' surface in the 1980s and 1990s. Future missions were flybys of Venus, on their way to other destinations in the Solar System. Marshas long been a planet of intense fascination for NASA, being suspected of potentially having harbored life.Mariner 5was the first NASA spacecraft to flyby Mars,followed byMariner 6andMariner 7.Mariner 9was the first orbital mission to Mars. Launched in 1975,Viking programconsisted of two landings on Mars in 1976. Follow-on missions would not be launched until 1996, with theMars Global Surveyororbiter andMars Pathfinder, deploying the first Mars rover,Sojourner.During the early 2000s, the2001 Mars Odysseyorbiter reached the planet and in 2004 theSpritandOpportunityrovers landed on the Red Planet. This was followed in 2005 by theMars Reconnaissance Orbiterand 2007PhoenixMars lander. The 2012 landing ofCuriositydiscovered that the radiation levels on Mars were equal to those on theInternational Space Station, greatly increasing the possibility of Human exploration, and observed the key chemical ingredients for life to occur. In 2013, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission observed the Martian upper atmosphere and space environment and in 2018, the Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations Geodesy, and Heat Transport (InSight) studied the Martian interior. The 2021Perseverancerover carried the first extraplanetary aircraft, a helicopter namedIngenuity. NASA also launched missions toMercuryin 2004, with theMESSENGERprobe demonstrating as the first use of asolar sail.NASA also launched probes to theouter Solar Systemstarting in the 1960s.Pioneer 10was the first probe to the outer planets, flying byJupiter, whilePioneer 11provided the first close up view of the planet. Both probes became the first objects to leave the Solar System. TheVoyager programlaunched in 1977, conducting flybys ofJupiterandSaturn,Neptune, andUranuson a trajectory to leave the Solar System.TheGalileospacecraft, deployed from the Space Shuttle flightSTS-34, was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, discovering evidence of subsurface oceans on theEuropaand observed that the moon may hold ice or liquid water.A joint NASA-European Space Agency-Italian Space Agencymission,Cassini–Huygens, was sent toSaturn's moonTitan, which, along with Mars and Europa, are the only celestial bodies in the Solar System suspected of being capable of harboring life.Cassini discovered three new moons of Saturn and theHuygensprobe entered Titan's atmosphere. The mission discovered evidence of liquid hydrocarbon lakes on Titan and subsurface water oceans on the moon ofEnceladus, which could harbor life. Finally launched in 2006, theNew Horizonsmission was the first spacecraft to visitPlutoand theKuiper belt. Beyond interplanetary probes, NASA has launched manyspace telescopes. Launched in the 1960s, theOrbiting Astronomical Observatorywere NASA's first orbital telescopes,providing ultraviolet, gamma-ray, x-ray, and infrared observations. NASA launched theOrbiting Geophysical Observatoryin the 1960s and 1970s to look down at Earth and observe its interactions with the Sun. TheUhurusatellite was the first dedicated x-ray telescope, mapping 85% of the sky and discovering a large number ofblack holes. Launched in the 1990s and early 2000s, theGreat Observatories programare among NASA's most powerful telescopes. TheHubble Space Telescopewas launched in 1990 onSTS-31from theDiscoveryand could view galaxies 15 billion light years away.A major defect in the telescope's mirror could have crippled the program, had NASA not used computer enhancement to compensate for the imperfection and launched five Space Shuttle servicing flights to replace the damaged components. TheCompton Gamma Ray Observatorywas launched from theAtlantisonSTS-37in 1991, discovering a possible source ofantimatterat the center of theMilky Wayand observing that the majority of gamma-ray bursts occur outside of the Milky Way galaxy. TheChandra X-ray Observatorywas launched from theColumbiaonSTS-93in 1999, observing black holes,quasars,supernova, anddark matter. It provided critical observations on theSagittarius A*black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and the separation of dark and regular matter during galactic collisions. Finally, theSpitzer Space Telescopeis an infrared telescope launched in 2003 from aDelta IIrocket. It is in a trailing orbit around the Sun, following the Earth and discovered the existence ofbrown dwarf stars. Other telescopes, such as theCosmic Background Explorerand theWilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, provided evidence to support theBig Bang.TheJames Webb Space Telescope, named after the NASA administrator who lead the Apollo program, is an infrared observatory launched in 2021. The James Webb Space Telescope is a direct successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, intended to observe the formation of the first galaxies.Other space telescopes include theKepler space telescope, launched in 2009 to identify planets orbiting extrasolar stars that may be Terran and possibly harbor life. The first exoplanet that the Kepler space telescope confirmed wasKepler-22b, orbiting within the habitable zone of its star. NASA also launched a number of different satellites to study Earth, such asTelevision Infrared Observation Satellite(TIROS) in 1960, which was the first weather satellite.NASA and theUnited States Weather Bureaucooperated on future TIROS and the second generationNimbus programof weather satellites. It also worked with theEnvironmental Science Services Administrationon a series of weather satellites and the agency launched its experimentalApplications Technology Satellitesinto geosynchronous orbit. NASA's first dedicated Earth observation satellite,Landsat, was launched in 1972. This led to NASA and theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationjointly developing theGeostationary Operational Environmental Satelliteand discoveringOzone depletion. NASA had been pursuingspaceplanedevelopment since the 1960s, blending the administration's dual aeronautics and space missions. NASA viewed a spaceplane as part of a larger program, providing routine and economical logistical support to aspace stationin Earth orbit that would be used as a hub for lunar and Mars missions. A reusable launch vehicle would then have ended the need for expensive and expendable boosters like theSaturn V. In 1969, NASA designated theJohnson Space Centeras the lead center for the design, development, and manufacturing of theSpace Shuttle orbiter, while theMarshall Space Flight Centerwould lead the development of the launch system. NASA's series oflifting bodyaircraft, culminating in the joint NASA-US Air ForceMartin Marietta X-24, directly informed the development of the Space Shuttle and future hypersonic flight aircraft. Official development of theSpace Shuttlebegan in 1972, withRockwell Internationalcontracted to design the orbiter and engines,Martin Mariettafor theexternal fuel tank, andMorton Thiokolfor thesolid rocket boosters.NASA acquired six orbiters: theEnterprise,Columbia,Challenger,Discovery,Atlantis, andEndeavour The Space Shuttle program also allowed NASA to make major changes to itsAstronaut Corps. While almost all previous astronauts were Air Force or Naval test pilots, the Space Shuttle allowed NASA to begin recruiting more non-military scientific and technical experts. A prime example isSally Ride, who became the first American woman to fly in space onSTS-7. This new astronaut selection process also allowed NASA to accept exchange astronauts from US allies and partners for the first time. The first Space Shuttle flight occurred in 1981, when theColumbialaunched on theSTS-1mission, designed to serve as a flight test for the new spaceplane.NASA intended for the Space Shuttle to replace expendable launch systems like the Air Force'sAtlas,Delta, andTitanand theEuropean Space Agency'sAriane. The Space Shuttle'sSpacelabpayload, developed by the European Space Agency, increased the scientific capabilities of shuttle missions over anything NASA was able to previously accomplish. NASA launched its first commercial satellites on theSTS-5mission and in 1984, theSTS-41-Cmission conducted the world's firston-orbit satellite servicingmission when theChallengercaptured and repaired the malfunctioningSolar Maximum Missionsatellite. It also had the capability to return malfunctioning satellite to Earth, like it did with thePalapa B2andWestar 6satellites. Once returned to Earth, the satellites were repaired and relaunched. Despite ushering in a new era of spaceflight, where NASA was contracting launch services to commercial companies, the Space Shuttle was criticized for not being as reusable and cost-effective as advertised. In 1986,Challengerdisasteron theSTS-51Lmission resulted in the loss of the spacecraft and all seven astronauts on launch, grounding the entire space shuttle fleet for 36 months and forced the 44 commercial companies that contracted with NASA to deploy their satellites to return to expendable launch vehicles.When the Space Shuttle returned to flight with theSTS-26mission, it had undergone significant modifications to improve its reliability and safety. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation and United States initiated theShuttle-Mirprogram.The first Russian cosmonaut flew on theSTS-60mission in 1994 and theDiscoveryrendezvoused, but did not dock with, the RussianMirin theSTS-63mission. This was followed byAtlantis'STS-71mission where it accomplished the initial intended mission for the Space Shuttle, docking with a space station and transferring supplies and personnel. The Shuttle-Mirprogram would continue until 1998, when a series of orbital accidents on the space station spelled an end to the program. In 2003, a second space shuttle was destroyed when theColumbiawasdestroyedupon reentry during theSTS-107mission, resulting in the loss of the spacecraft and all seven astronauts.This accident marked the beginning of the retiring of the Space Shuttle program, with PresidentGeorge W. Bushdirecting that upon the completion of the International Space Station, the space shuttle be retired. In 2006, the Space Shuttle returned to flight, conducting several mission to service theHubble Space Telescope, but was retired following theSTS-135resupply mission to the International Space Station in 2011. NASA never gave up on the idea of a space station after Skylab's reentry in 1979. The agency began lobbying politicians to support building a larger space station as soon as the Space Shuttle began flying, selling it as an orbital laboratory, repair station, and a jumping off point for lunar and Mars missions. NASA found a strong advocate in PresidentRonald Reagan, who declared in a 1984 speech: America has always been greatest when we dared to be great. We can reach for greatness again. We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for peaceful, economic, and scientific gain. Tonight I am directing NASA to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade. In 1985, NASA proposed theSpace StationFreedom, which both the agency and President Reagan intended to be an international program.While this would add legitimacy to the program, there were concerns within NASA that the international component would dilute its authority within the project, having never been willing to work with domestic or international partners as true equals. There was also a concern with sharing sensitive space technologies with the Europeans, which had the potential to dilute America's technical lead. Ultimately, an international agreement to develop the Space StationFreedomprogram would be signed with thirteen countries in 1985, including theEuropean Space Agencymember states,Canada, andJapan. Despite its status as the first international space program, the Space StationFreedomwas controversial, with much of the debate centering on cost. Several redesigns to reduce cost were conducted in the early 1990s, stripping away much of its functions. Despite calls for Congress to terminate the program, it continued, in large part because by 1992 it had created 75,000 jobs across 39 states. By 1993, PresidentBill Clintonattempted to significantly reduce NASA's budget and directed costs be significantly reduced, aerospace industry jobs were not lost, and the Russians be included. In 1993, the Clinton Administration announced that the Space StationFreedomwould become theInternational Space Stationin an agreement with the Russian Federation.This allowed the Russians to maintain their space program through an infusion of American currency to maintain their status as one of the two premier space programs. While the United States built and launched the majority of the International Space Station, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the European Space Agency all contributed components. Despite NASA's insistence that costs would be kept at a budget of $17.4, they kept rising and NASA had to transfer funds from other programs to keep the International Space Station solvent. Ultimately, the total cost of the station was $150 billion, with the United States paying for two-thirds. Following the Space ShuttleColumbiadisaster in 2003, NASA was forced to rely on RussianSoyuzlaunches for its astronauts and the 2011 retirement of the Space Shuttle accelerated the station's completion. In the 1980s, right after the first flight of the Space Shuttle, NASA started a joint program with the Department of Defense to develop theRockwell X-30National Aerospace Plane. NASA realized that the Space Shuttle, while a massive technological accomplishment, would not be able to live up to all its promises. Designed to be asingle-stage-to-orbitspaceplane, the X-30 had both civil and military applications. With the end of theCold War, the X-30 was canceled in 1992 before reaching flight status. Following theSpace ShuttleColumbiadisasterin 2003, President Bush started theConstellation programto smoothly replace the Space Shuttle and expand space exploration beyond low Earth orbit.Constellation was intended to use a significant amount of former Space Shuttle equipment and return astronauts to the Moon. This program was canceled by theObama Administration. Former astronautsNeil Armstrong,Gene Cernan, andJim Lovellsent a letter to PresidentBarack Obamato warn him that if the United States did not get new human spaceflight ability, the US risked become a second or third-rate space power. As early as the Reagan Administration, there had been calls for NASA to expand private sector involvement in space exploration rather than do it all in-house. In the 1990s, NASA and Lockheed Martin entered into an agreement to develop theLockheed Martin X-33demonstrator of theVentureStarspaceplane, which was intended to replace the Space Shuttle.Due to technical challenges, the spacecraft was cancelled in 2001. Despite this, it was the first time a commercial space company directly expended a significant amount of its resources into spacecraft development. The advent ofspace tourismalso forced NASA to challenge its assumption that only governments would have people in space. The first space tourist wasDennis Tito, an American investment manager and former aerospace engineer who contracted with the Russians to fly to the International Space Station for four days, despite the opposition of NASA to the idea. Advocates of this new commercial approach for NASA included former astronautBuzz Aldrin, who remarked that it would return NASA to its roots as a research and development agency, with commercial entities actually operating the space systems. Having corporations take over orbital operations would also allow NASA to focus all its efforts on deep space exploration and returning humans to the Moon and going to Mars. Embracing this approach, NASA'sCommercial Crew Programstarted by contracting cargo delivery to the International Space Station and flew its first operational contracted mission onSpaceX Crew-1. This marked the first time since the retirement of the Space Shuttle that NASA was able to launch its own astronauts on an American spacecraft from the United States, ending a decade of reliance on the Russians. In 2019, NASA announced theArtemis program, intending to return to the Moon and establish a permanent human presence.This was paired with theArtemis Accordswith partner nations to establish rules of behavior and norms of space commercialization on the Moon. In 2023, NASA established the Moon to Mars Program office. The office is designed to oversee the various projects, mission architectures and associated timelines relevant to lunar and Mars exploration and science. TheInternational Space Station(ISS) combines NASA'sSpace StationFreedomproject with the RussianMir-2station, the EuropeanColumbusstation, and the JapaneseKibōlaboratory module.NASA originally planned in the 1980s to developFreedomalone, but US budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, theRussian Federal Space Agency(RKA), theJapan Aerospace Exploration Agency(JAXA), theEuropean Space Agency(ESA), and theCanadian Space Agency(CSA).The station consists of pressurized modules, externaltrusses,solar arraysand other components, which weremanufacturedin various factories around the world and launched by RussianProtonandSoyuzrockets, and the American Space Shuttle.The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of theUS Orbital Segmentoccurred in 2009 and the completion of theRussian Orbital Segmentoccurred in 2010. The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements,which divide the station into two areas and allowRussiato retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception ofZarya),with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners. Long-duration missions to the ISS are referred to asISS Expeditions. Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS.The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following theColumbiadisaster. Between May 2009 and until the retirement of the Space Shuttle, the expedition crew size has been six crew members.As of 2024, though the Commercial Program's crew capsules can allow a crew of up to seven, expeditions using them typically consist of a crew of four. The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past 24 years and 360 days, having exceeded the previous record held byMir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from15 different nations. The station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, as of 2025, is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station.The RussianSoyuzand AmericanDragonandStarlinerspacecraft are used to send astronauts to and from the ISS. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft provide service to the ISS; they are the RussianProgress spacecraftwhich has done so since 2000, the EuropeanAutomated Transfer Vehicle(ATV) since 2008, the JapaneseH-II Transfer Vehicle(HTV) since 2009, the (uncrewed)Dragonsince 2012, and the AmericanCygnus spacecraftsince 2013.The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Between the retirement of the Shuttle in 2011 and the commencement of crewed Dragon flights in 2020, American astronauts exclusively used the Soyuz for crew transport to and from the ISSThe highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions. The ISS program is expected to continue until 2030,after which the space station will be retired and destroyed in a controlled de-orbit. Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) are a contract solution to deliver cargo and supplies to the International Space Station on a commercial basis by private companies.NASA signed its first CRS contracts in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion toSpaceXfor twelve cargoDragonand $1.9 billion toOrbital Sciences[note 1]for eightCygnusflights, covering deliveries until 2016. Both companies evolved or created their launch vehicle products to launch the spacecrafts (SpaceX with TheFalcon 9and Orbital with theAntares). SpaceX flew its first operational resupply mission (SpaceX CRS-1) in 2012.Orbital Sciences followed in 2014 (Cygnus CRS Orb-1).In 2015, NASA extended CRS-1 to twenty flights for SpaceX and twelve flights forOrbital ATK.[note 1] A second phase of contracts (known as CRS-2) was solicited in 2014; contracts were awarded in January 2016 to Orbital ATK[note 1]Cygnus,Sierra Nevada CorporationDream Chaser, and SpaceXDragon 2, for cargo transport flights beginning in 2019 and expected to last through 2024. In March 2022, NASA awarded an additional six CRS-2 missions each to both SpaceX and Northrop Grumman (formerly Orbital). Northrop Grummansuccessfully deliveredCygnus NG-17to the ISS in February 2022.In July 2022, SpaceX launched its 25th CRS flight (SpaceX CRS-25) and successfully delivered its cargo to the ISS.The Dream Chaser spacecraft is currently scheduled for its Demo-1 launch in the first half of 2024. The Commercial Crew Program (CCP) providescommercially operatedcrew transportation serviceto and from the International Space Station (ISS) under contract to NASA, conducting crew rotations between theexpeditionsof theInternational Space Station program. Americanspace manufacturerSpaceXbegan providing service in 2020, using theCrew Dragonspacecraft,whileBoeing'sStarlinerspacecraft provided service in 2024. It was on contract for 6 missions, but after the first mission nearly ended in disaster and left the two astronauts stranded on the ISS for six months, NASA froze its contract with Boeing.NASA has contracted for six operational missions from Boeing and fourteen from SpaceX, ensuring sufficient support for ISS through 2030. The spacecraft are owned and operated by the vendor, and crew transportation is provided to NASA as a commercial service.Each mission sends up to four astronauts to the ISS, with an option for a fifth passenger available. Operational flights occur approximately once every six months for missions that last for approximately six months. A spacecraft remains docked to the ISS during its mission, and missions usually overlap by at least a few days. Between the retirement of theSpace Shuttlein 2011 and the first operational CCP mission in 2020, NASA relied on theSoyuz programto transport its astronauts to the ISS. A Crew Dragon spacecraft is launched to space atop aFalcon 9 Block 5launch vehicle and the capsule returns to Earth viasplashdownin the ocean near Florida. The program's first operational mission,SpaceX Crew-1, launched on November 16, 2020.Boeing Starlineroperational flights will now commence withBoeing Starliner-1which will launched atop anAtlas VN22 launch vehicle. Instead of a splashdown, Starliner capsules return on land withairbagsat one of four designated sites in the western United States. Since 2017, NASA'screwed spaceflight programhas been theArtemis program, which involves the help of UScommercial spaceflight companiesand international partners such asESA,JAXA, andCSA.The goal of this program is to land "the first woman and the next man" on thelunar south poleregion by 2025. Artemis would be the first step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans toMars. TheOrionCrew Exploration Vehicle was held over from the canceled Constellation program for Artemis.Artemis Iwas the uncrewed initial launch ofSpace Launch System(SLS) that would also send an Orion spacecraft on aDistant Retrograde Orbit. The first tentative steps of returning to crewed lunar missions will beArtemis II, which is to include the Orion crew module, propelled by the SLS, and is expected to launch no later than April 2026.This mission is to be a 10-day mission planned to briefly place a crew of four into aLunar flyby.Artemis IIIaims to conduct the first crewed lunar landing sinceApollo 17, and is scheduled for no earlier than mid-2027.[citation needed] In support of the Artemis missions, NASA has been funding private companies to land robotic probes on the lunar surface in a program known as theCommercial Lunar Payload Services. As of March 2022, NASA has awarded contracts for robotic lunar probes to companies such asIntuitive Machines,Firefly Space Systems, andAstrobotic. On April 16, 2021, NASA announced they had selected theSpaceX Lunar Starshipas its Human Landing System. The agency's Space Launch System rocket will launch four astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft for their multi-day journey to lunar orbit where they will transfer to SpaceX's Starship for the final leg of their journey to the surface of the Moon. In November 2021, it was announced that the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by 2024 had slipped to no earlier than 2027 due to numerous factors. Artemis I launched on November 16, 2022, and returned to Earth safely on December 11, 2022. As of April 2025, NASA plans to launch Artemis II in April 2026.and Artemis III in 2027.Additional Artemis missions,Artemis IV,Artemis V, andArtemis VIare planned to launch between 2028 and 2031. NASA's next major space initiative is the construction of theLunar Gateway, a small space station inlunar orbit.This space station will be designed primarily for non-continuous human habitation. The construction of the Gateway is expected to begin in 2027 with the launch of the first two modules: thePower and Propulsion Element(PPE) and theHabitation and Logistics Outpost(HALO).Operations on the Gateway will begin with theArtemis IVmission, which plans to deliver a crew of four to the Gateway in 2028. In 2017, NASA was directed by the congressional NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 to get humans to Mars-orbit (or to the Martian surface) by the 2030s. The Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations program is an initiative by NASA to support work on commercial space stations that the agency hopes to have in place by the end of the current decade to replace the "International Space Station". The three selected companies are:Blue Origin(et al.) with theirOrbital Reefstation concept,Nanoracks(et al.) with theirStarlab Space Stationconcept, andNorthrop Grummanwith a station concept based on the HALO-module for the Gateway station. NASA has conducted many uncrewed and robotic spaceflight programs throughout its history. More than 1,000 uncrewed missions have been designed to explore the Earth and the Solar System. NASA executes a mission development framework to plan, select, develop, and operate robotic missions. This framework defines cost, schedule and technical risk parameters to enable competitive selection of missions involving mission candidates that have been developed by principal investigators and their teams from across NASA, the broader US Government research and development stakeholders, and industry. The mission development construct is defined by four umbrella programs. The Explorer program derives its origin from the earliest days of the US Space program. In current form, the program consists of three classes of systems –Small Explorers (SMEX),Medium Explorers (MIDEX), andUniversity-Class Explorers (UNEX)missions. The NASA Explorer program office provides frequent flight opportunities for moderate cost innovative solutions from the heliophysics and astrophysics science areas. The Small Explorer missions are required to limit cost to NASA to below $150M (2022 dollars). Medium class explorer missions have typically involved NASA cost caps of $350M. The Explorer program office is based at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The NASA Discovery program develops and delivers robotic spacecraft solutions in the planetary science domain. Discovery enables scientists and engineers to assemble a team to deliver a solution against a defined set of objectives and competitively bid that solution against other candidate programs. Cost caps vary but recent mission selection processes were accomplished using a $500M cost cap for NASA. The Planetary Mission Program Office is based at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and manages both the Discovery and New Frontiers missions. The office is part of the Science Mission Directorate. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson announced on June 2, 2021, that theDAVINCI+andVERITASmissions were selected to launch to Venus in the late 2020s, having beat out competing proposals for missions to Jupiter's volcanic moon Io and Neptune's large moonTritonthat were also selected as Discovery program finalists in early 2020. Each mission has an estimated cost of $500 million, with launches expected between 2028 and 2030. Launch contracts will be awarded later in each mission's development. The New Frontiers program focuses on specificSolar Systemexploration goals identified as top priorities by the planetary science community. Primary objectives include Solar System exploration employing medium class spacecraft missions to conduct high-science-return investigations. New Frontiers builds on the development approach employed by the Discovery program but provides for higher cost caps and schedule durations than are available with Discovery. Cost caps vary by opportunity; recent missions have been awarded based on a defined cap of $1 billion. The higher cost cap and projected longer mission durations result in a lower frequency of new opportunities for the program – typically one every several years.OSIRIS-RExandNew Horizonsare examples of New Frontiers missions. NASA has determined that the next opportunity to propose for the fifth round of New Frontiers missions will occur no later than the fall of 2024. Missions in NASA's New Frontiers Program tackle specific Solar System exploration goals identified as top priorities by the planetary science community. Exploring the Solar System with medium-class spacecraft missions that conduct high-science-return investigations is NASA's strategy to further understand the Solar System. Large strategic missions (formerly called Flagship missions) are strategic missions that are typically developed and managed by large teams that may span several NASA centers. The individual missions become the program as opposed to being part of a larger effort (see Discovery, New Frontiers, etc.). TheJames Webb Space Telescopeis a strategic mission that was developed over a period of more than 20 years. Strategic missions are developed on an ad-hoc basis as program objectives and priorities are established. Missions like Voyager, had they been developed today, would have been strategic missions. Three of the Great Observatories were strategic missions (theChandra X-ray Observatory, theCompton Gamma Ray Observatory, and theHubble Space Telescope).Europa Clipperis the next large strategic mission in development by NASA. NASA continues to play a material role in exploration of the Solar System as it has for decades. Ongoing missions have current science objectives with respect to more than five extraterrestrial bodies within the Solar System – Moon (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter), Mars (Perseverancerover), Jupiter (Juno), asteroidBennu(OSIRIS-REx), and Kuiper Belt Objects (New Horizons). TheJunoextended mission will make multiple flybys of the Jovian moon Io in 2023 and 2024 after flybys ofGanymedein 2021 andEuropain 2022.Voyager 1andVoyager 2continue to provide science data back to Earth while continuing on their outward journeys into interstellar space. On November 26, 2011, NASA'sMars Science Laboratorymission was successfully launched for Mars. TheCuriosityrover successfully landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on Mars. In September 2014, NASA'sMAVENspacecraft, which is part of theMars Scout Program, successfully entered Mars orbit and, as of October 2022, continues its study of theatmosphere of Mars.NASA's ongoing Mars investigations include in-depth surveys of Mars by thePerseverancerover. NASA'sEuropa Clipper, launched in October 2024, will study the Galilean moon Europa through a series of flybys while in orbit around Jupiter.Dragonflywill send a mobile roboticrotorcraftto Saturn's biggest moon,Titan.As of May 2021,Dragonflyis scheduled for launch in June 2027. The NASA Science Mission Directorate Astrophysics division manages the agency's astrophysics science portfolio. NASA has invested significant resources in the development, delivery, and operations of various forms of space telescopes. These telescopes have provided the means to study the cosmos over a large range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Great Observatories that were launched in the 1980s and 1990s have provided a wealth of observations for study by physicists across the planent. The first of them, theHubble Space Telescope, was delivered to orbit in 1990 and continues to function, in part due to prior servicing missions performed by the Space Shuttle.The other remaining active great observatories include theChandra X-ray Observatory(CXO), launched bySTS-93in July 1999 and is now in a 64-hourelliptical orbitstudying X-ray sources that are not readily viewable from terrestrial observatories. TheImaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer(IXPE) is a space observatory designed to improve the understanding of X-ray production in objects such as neutron stars and pulsar wind nebulae, as well as stellar and supermassive black holes.IXPE launched in December 2021 and is an international collaboration between NASA and theItalian Space Agency(ASI). It is part of the NASASmall Explorers program(SMEX) which designs low-cost spacecraft to study heliophysics and astrophysics. TheNeil Gehrels Swift Observatorywas launched in November 2004 and is a gamma-ray burst observatory that also monitors the afterglow in X-ray, and UV/Visible light at the location of a burst.The mission was developed in a joint partnership betweenGoddard Space Flight Center(GSFC) and an international consortium from the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy.Pennsylvania State Universityoperates the mission as part of NASA'sMedium Explorer program(MIDEX). TheFermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope(FGST) is another gamma-ray focused space observatory that was launched tolow Earth orbitin June 2008 and is being used to performgamma-ray astronomyobservations.In addition to NASA, the mission involves theUnited States Department of Energy, and government agencies in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden. TheJames Webb Space Telescope(JWST), launched in December 2021 on anAriane 5rocket, operates in ahalo orbitcircling the Sun-EarthL2point.JWST's high sensitivity in the infrared spectrum and its imaging resolution will allow it to view more distant, faint, or older objects than its predecessors, including Hubble. NASA Earth Science is a large, umbrella program comprising a range of terrestrial and space-based collection systems in order to better understand the Earth system and its response to natural and human-caused changes. Numerous systems have been developed and fielded over several decades to provide improved prediction for weather, climate, and other changes in the natural environment. Several of the current operating spacecraft programs include:Aqua,Aura,Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2(OCO-2),Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-on (GRACE FO),andIce, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2). In addition to systems already in orbit, NASA is designing a new set of Earth Observing Systems to study, assess, and generate responses for climate change, natural hazards, forest fires, and real-time agricultural processes.The GOES-T satellite (designatedGOES-18after launch) joined the fleet of US geostationary weather monitoring satellites in March 2022. NASA also maintains the Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program to oversee the life cycle of NASA's Earth science data – from acquisition through processing and distribution. The primary goal of ESDS is to maximize the scientific return from NASA's missions and experiments for research and applied scientists, decision makers, and society at large. The Earth Science program is managed by the Earth Science Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate. NASA invests in various ground and space-based infrastructures to support its science and exploration mandate. The agency maintains access to suborbital and orbital space launch capabilities and sustains ground station solutions to support its evolving fleet of spacecraft and remote systems. TheNASA Deep Space Network(DSN) serves as the primary ground station solution for NASA's interplanetary spacecraft and select Earth-orbiting missions.The system employs ground station complexes near Barstow, California, in Spain near Madrid, and in Australia near Canberra. The placement of these ground stations approximately 120 degrees apart around the planet provides the ability for communications to spacecraft throughout theSolar Systemeven as the Earth rotates about its axis on a daily basis. The system is controlled at a 24x7 operations center at JPL in Pasadena, California, which manages recurring communications linkages with up to 40 spacecraft.The system is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The Near Space Network (NSN) provides telemetry, commanding, ground-based tracking, data and communications services to a wide range of customers with satellites in low earth orbit (LEO), geosynchronous orbit (GEO), highly elliptical orbits (HEO), and lunar orbits. The NSN accumulates ground station and antenna assets from the Near-Earth Network and theTracking and Data Relay Satellite System(TDRS) which operates in geosynchronous orbit providing continuous real-time coverage for launch vehicles and low earth orbit NASA missions. The NSN consists of 19 ground stations worldwide operated by the US Government and by contractors including Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), and South African National Space Agency (SANSA).The ground network averages between 120 and 150 spacecraft contacts a day with TDRS engaging with systems on a near-continuous basis as needed; the system is managed and operated by the Goddard Space Flight Center. TheNASA Sounding Rocket Program(NSRP) is located at theWallops Flight Facilityand provides launch capability, payload development and integration, and field operations support to execute suborbital missions.The program has been in operation since 1959 and is managed by the Goddard Space Flight Center using a combined US Government and contractor team.The NSRP team conducts approximately 20 missions per year from both Wallops and other launch locations worldwide to allow scientists to collect data "where it occurs". The program supports the strategic vision of the Science Mission Directorate collecting important scientific data for earth science, heliophysics, and astrophysics programs. In June 2022, NASA conducted its first rocket launch from a commercial spaceport outside the US. It launched aBlack Brant IXfrom theArnhem Space Centrein Australia. The NASA Launch Services Program (LSP) is responsible for procurement of launch services for NASA uncrewed missions and oversight of launch integration and launch preparation activity, providing added quality and mission assurance to meet program objectives.Since 1990, NASA has purchasedexpendable launch vehicle launch servicesdirectly from commercial providers, whenever possible, for its scientific and applications missions. Expendable launch vehicles can accommodate all types of orbit inclinations and altitudes and are ideal vehicles for launching Earth-orbit and interplanetary missions. LSP operates from Kennedy Space Center and falls under the NASA Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD). TheAeronautics Research Mission Directorate(ARMD) is one of five missiondirectorateswithin NASA, the other four being the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, the Space Operations Mission Directorate, theScience Mission Directorate, and the Space Technology Mission Directorate.The ARMD is responsible for NASA'saeronauticalresearch, which benefits thecommercial,military, andgeneral aviationsectors. ARMD performs its aeronautics research at four NASA facilities:Ames Research CenterandArmstrong Flight Research Centerin California,Glenn Research Centerin Ohio, andLangley Research Centerin Virginia. TheNASA X-57 Maxwellis an experimental aircraft being developed by NASA to demonstrate the technologies required to deliver a highly efficient all-electric aircraft.The primary goal of the program is to develop and deliver all-electric technology solutions that can also achieve airworthiness certification with regulators. The program involves development of the system in several phases, or modifications, to incrementally grow the capability and operability of the system. The initial configuration of the aircraft has now completed ground testing as it approaches its first flights. In mid-2022, the X-57 was scheduled to fly before the end of the year.The development team includes staff from the NASA Armstrong, Glenn, and Langley centers along with number of industry partners from the United States and Italy. NASA is collaborating with theFederal Aviation Administrationand industry stakeholders to modernize the United StatesNational Airspace System(NAS). Efforts began in 2007 with a goal to deliver major modernization components by 2025.The modernization effort intends to increase the safety, efficiency, capacity, access, flexibility, predictability, and resilience of the NAS while reducing theenvironmental impact of aviation.The Aviation Systems Division of NASA Ames operates the joint NASA/FAA North Texas Research Station. The station supports all phases of NextGen research, from concept development to prototype system field evaluation. This facility has already transitioned advanced NextGen concepts and technologies to use through technology transfers to the FAA.NASA contributions also include development of advanced automation concepts and tools that provide air traffic controllers, pilots, and other airspace users with more accurate real-time information about the nation's traffic flow, weather, and routing. Ames' advanced airspace modeling and simulation tools have been used extensively to model the flow of air traffic flow across the US, and to evaluate new concepts in airspace design, traffic flow management, and optimization. NASA has made use of technologies such as themulti-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator(MMRTG), which is a type ofradioisotope thermoelectric generatorused to power spacecraft.Shortages of the requiredplutonium-238have curtailed deep space missions since the turn of the millennium.An example of a spacecraft that was not developed because of a shortage of this material wasNew Horizons 2. In July 2021, NASA announced contract awards for development ofnuclear thermal propulsionreactors. Three contractors will develop individual designs over 12 months for later evaluation by NASA and theUS Department of Energy.NASA's space nuclear technologies portfolio are led and funded by its Space Technology Mission Directorate. In January 2023, NASA announced a partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) on theDemonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations(DRACO) program to demonstrate a NTR engine in space, an enabling capability for NASA missions to Mars.In July 2023, NASA and DARPA jointly announced the award of $499 million to Lockheed Martin to design and build an experimental NTR rocket to be launched in 2027. In July 2025, Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy issued a directive to fast-track plans for placing a nuclear reactor on the Moon to support the agency's Artemis program and maintain U.S. leadership in space exploration. The directive, prompted by concerns that China and Russia may deploy a joint lunar reactor by the mid-2030s, emphasizes the need for a 100-kilowatt system to power long-term lunar missions. Duffy warned that if another nation establishes a reactor first, it could create "keep-out zones" limiting U.S. access. Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center(SEDAC), founded in 1994, "focuses on archiving and distributing data related to human interactions in the environment. SEDAC synthesizes Earth science and socioeconomic data and information" inPalisades, NY,with partnerCenter for Integrated Earth System Information,Columbia University.SEDAC has extensivegeospatial dataholdings. Free Space Optics. NASA contracted a third party to study the probability of using Free Space Optics (FSO) to communicate with Optical (laser) Stations on the Ground (OGS) called laser-comRFnetworks for satellite communications. Water Extraction from Lunar Soil. On July 29, 2020, NASA requested American universities to propose new technologies for extracting water from thelunar soiland developing power systems. The idea will help the space agency conductsustainableexploration of the Moon. In 2024, NASA was tasked by theUS Governmentto create aTime standardfor theMoon. The standard is to be calledCoordinated Lunar Timeand is expected to be finalized in 2026. NASA'sHuman Research Program(HRP) is designed to study the effects of space on human health and also to provide countermeasures and technologies for human space exploration.The medical effects of space exploration are reasonably limited in low Earth orbit or in travel to the Moon. Travel to Mars is significantly longer and deeper into space, significant medical issues can result. These include bone density loss, radiation exposure, vision changes, circadian rhythm disturbances, heart remodeling, and immune alterations. In order to study and diagnose these ill-effects, HRP has been tasked with identifying or developing small portable instrumentation with low mass, volume, and power to monitor the health of astronauts.To achieve this aim, on May 13, 2022, NASA andSpaceX Crew-4astronauts successfully tested its rHEALTH ONE universal biomedical analyzer for its ability to identify and analyzer biomarkers, cells, microorganisms, and proteins in a spaceflight environment. NASA established the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) in 2016 to catalog and track potentially hazardousnear-Earth objects(NEO), such asasteroidsandcometsand develop potential responses and defenses against these threats.The PDCO is chartered to provide timely and accurate information to the government and the public on close approaches byPotentially hazardous objects(PHOs) and any potential for impact. The office functions within the Science Mission DirectoratePlanetary Science Division. The PDCO augmented prior cooperative actions between the United States, the European Union, and other nations which had been scanning the sky for NEOs since 1998 in an effort calledSpaceguard. From the 1990s NASA has run many NEO detection programs from Earth bases observatories, greatly increasing the number of objects that have been detected. Many asteroids are very dark and those near the Sun are much harder to detect from Earth-based telescopes which observe at night, and thus face away from the Sun. NEOs inside Earth orbit only reflect a part of light also rather than potentially a "full Moon" when they are behind the Earth and fully lit by the Sun. In 1998, theUnited States Congressgave NASA a mandate to detect 90% of near-Earth asteroids over 1 km (0.62 mi) diameter (that threaten global devastation) by 2008.This initial mandate was met by 2011.In 2005, the original USA Spaceguard mandate was extended by theGeorge E. Brown, Jr.Near-Earth Object Survey Act, which calls for NASA to detect 90% of NEOs with diameters of 140 m (460 ft) or greater, by 2020 (compare to the 20-meterChelyabinsk meteorthat hit Russia in 2013).As of January 2020[update], it is estimated that less than half of these have been found, but objects of this size hit the Earth only about once in 2,000 years. In January 2020, NASA officials estimated it would take 30 years to find all objects meeting the 140 m (460 ft) size criteria, more than twice the timeframe that was built into the 2005 mandate.In June 2021, NASA authorized the development of theNEO Surveyorspacecraft to reduce that projected duration to achieve the mandate down to 10 years. NASA has incorporated planetary defense objectives into several ongoing missions. In 1999, NASA visited433 Eroswith theNEAR Shoemakerspacecraft which entered its orbit in 2000, closely imaging the asteroid with various instruments at that time.NEAR Shoemakerbecame the first spacecraft to successfully orbit and land on an asteroid, improving our understanding of these bodies and demonstrating our capacity to study them in greater detail. OSIRIS-RExused its suite of instruments to transmit radio tracking signals and capture optical images ofBennuduring its study of the asteroid that will help NASA scientists determine its precise position in the solar system and its exact orbital path. As Bennu has the potential for recurring approaches to the Earth-Moon system in the next 100–200 years, the precision gained from OSIRIS-REx will enable scientists to better predict the future gravitational interactions between Bennu and our planet and resultant changes in Bennu's onward flight path. TheWISE/NEOWISEmission was launched by NASA JPL in 2009 as an infrared-wavelength astronomical space telescope. In 2013, NASA repurposed it as the NEOWISE mission to find potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and comets; its mission has been extended into 2023. NASA andJohns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory(JHAPL) jointly developed the first planetary defense purpose-built satellite, theDouble Asteroid Redirection Test(DART) to test possible planetary defense concepts.DART was launched in November 2021 by a SpaceX Falcon 9 from California on a trajectory designed to impact theDimorphosasteroid. Scientists were seeking to determine whether an impact could alter the subsequent path of the asteroid; a concept that could be applied to future planetary defense.On September 26, 2022, DART hit its target. In the weeks following impact, NASA declared DART a success, confirming it had shortened Dimorphos' orbital period around Didymos by about 32 minutes, surpassing the pre-defined success threshold of 73 seconds. NEO Surveyor, formerly called the Near-Earth Object Camera (NEOCam) mission, is a space-basedinfrared telescopeunder development to survey theSolar Systemforpotentially hazardous asteroids.The spacecraft is scheduled to launch in 2026. In June 2022, the head of the NASAScience Mission Directorate,Thomas Zurbuchen, confirmed the start ofNASA's UAP independent study team.At a speech before the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, Zurbuchen said the space agency would bring a scientific perspective to efforts already underway by the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to make sense of dozens of such sightings. He said it was "high-risk, high-impact" research that the space agency should not shy away from, even if it is a controversial field of study. In response to theApollo 1accident, which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's air and space programs. In the aftermath of theShuttleColumbiadisaster, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress.By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).TheNASA Authorization Act of 2014reaffirmed the importance of ASAP. NASA and NOAA have cooperated for decades on the development, delivery and operation of polar and geosynchronous weather satellites.The relationship typically involves NASA developing the space systems, launch solutions, and ground control technology for the satellites and NOAA operating the systems and delivering weather forecasting products to users. Multiple generations of NOAA Polar orbiting platforms have operated to provide detailed imaging of weather from low altitude.Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites(GOES) provide near-real-time coverage of the western hemisphere to ensure accurate and timely understanding of developing weather phenomenon. TheUnited States Space Force(USSF) is the space service branch of theUnited States Armed Forces, while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for civil spaceflight. NASA and the Space Force's predecessors in the Air Force have a long-standing cooperative relationship, with the Space Force supporting NASA launches out ofKennedy Space Center,Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, andVandenberg Space Force Base, to include range support and rescue operations from Task Force 45.NASA and the Space Force also partner on matters such as defending Earth from asteroids.Space Force members can be NASA astronauts, with ColonelMichael S. Hopkins, the commander ofSpaceX Crew-1, commissioned into the Space Force from theInternational Space Stationon December 18, 2020.In September 2020, the Space Force and NASA signed amemorandum of understandingformally acknowledging the joint role of both agencies. This new memorandum replaced a similar document signed in 2006 between NASA and Air Force Space Command. TheLandsat programis the longest-running enterprise for acquisition ofsatellite imageryof Earth. It is a joint NASA /USGSprogram.On July 23, 1972, theEarth Resources Technology Satellitewas launched. This was eventually renamed toLandsat 1in 1975.The most recent satellite in the series,Landsat 9, was launched on September 27, 2021. The instruments on the Landsat satellites have acquired millions of images. The images, archived in theUnited Statesand at Landsat receiving stations around the world, are a unique resource for global change research and applications inagriculture,cartography,geology,forestry,regional planning,surveillanceandeducation, and can be viewed through the US Geological Survey (USGS) "EarthExplorer" website. The collaboration between NASA and USGS involves NASA designing and delivering the space system (satellite) solution, launching the satellite into orbit with the USGS operating the system once in orbit.As of October 2022, nine satellites have been built with eight of them successfully operating in orbit. NASA collaborates with the European Space Agency on a wide range of scientific and exploration requirements.From participation with the Space Shuttle (the Spacelab missions) to major roles on the Artemis program (the Orion Service Module), ESA and NASA have supported the science and exploration missions of each agency. There are NASA payloads on ESA spacecraft and ESA payloads on NASA spacecraft. The agencies have developed joint missions in areas including heliophysics (e.g.Solar Orbiter)and astronomy (Hubble Space Telescope,James Webb Space Telescope). Under the Artemis Gateway partnership, ESA will contribute habitation and refueling modules, along with enhanced lunar communications, to the Gateway.NASA and ESA continue to advance cooperation in relation to Earth Science including climate change with agreements to cooperate on various missions including theSentinel-6series of spacecraft In September 2014, NASA and theIndian Space Research Organisation(ISRO) signed a partnership to collaborate on and launch a joint radar mission, theNASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperature Radar(NISAR) mission. The mission was launched on July 30, 2025.NASA has provided the mission'sL-bandsynthetic aperture radar, a high-rate communication subsystem for science data, GPS receivers, a solid-state recorder and payload data subsystem. ISRO has provided the spacecraft bus, theS-bandradar, the launch vehicle and associated launch services. NASA and theJapan Aerospace Exploration Agency(JAXA) cooperate on a range of space projects. JAXA is a direct participant in the Artemis program, including the Lunar Gateway effort. JAXA's planned contributions to Gateway include I-Hab's environmental control and life support system, batteries, thermal control, and imagery components, which will be integrated into the module by the European Space Agency (ESA) prior to launch. These capabilities are critical for sustained Gateway operations during crewed and uncrewed time periods. JAXA and NASA have collaborated on numerous satellite programs, especially in areas of Earth science. NASA has contributed to JAXA satellites and vice versa. Japanese instruments are flying on NASA'sTerraandAquasatellites, and NASA sensors have flown on previous Japanese Earth-observation missions. The NASA-JAXAGlobal Precipitation Measurementmission was launched in 2014 and includes both NASA- and JAXA-supplied sensors on a NASA satellite launched on a JAXA rocket. The mission provides the frequent, accurate measurements of rainfall over the entire globe for use by scientists and weather forecasters. NASA and Roscosmos have cooperated on the development and operation of the International Space Station since September 1993.The agencies have used launch systems from both countries to deliver station elements to orbit. Astronauts and Cosmonauts jointly maintain various elements of the station. Both countries provide access to the station via launch systems noting Russia's unique role as the sole provider of delivery of crew and cargo upon retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 and prior to commencement of NASA COTS and crew flights. In July 2022, NASA and Roscosmos signed a deal to share space station flights enabling crew from each country to ride on the systems provided by the other.Current geopolitical conditions in late 2022 make it unlikely that cooperation will be extended to other programs such as Artemis or lunar exploration. TheArtemis Accordshave been established to define a framework for cooperating in the peaceful exploration and exploitation of theMoon,Mars,asteroids, andcomets. The accords were drafted by NASA and the US State Department and are executed as a series of bilateral agreements between the United States and the participating countries.As of June 2023, 22 countries have signed the accords. They are Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Wolf Amendment was passed by the US Congress into law in 2011 and prevents NASA from engaging in direct, bilateral cooperation with the Chinese government and China-affiliated organizations such as the China National Space Administration without the explicit authorization from Congress and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The law has been renewed annually since by inclusion in annual appropriations bills. The agency's administration is located atNASA Headquartersin Washington, DC, and provides overall guidance and direction.Except under exceptional circumstances, NASA civil service employees are required to beUS citizens.NASA's administrator is nominated by the President of the United States subject to the approval of theUS Senate,and serves at the President's pleasure as a senior space science advisor. The current interim administrator is transportation secretarySean Duffy, appointed by PresidentDonald Trump. The administration's original nominee ofJared Isaacmanwas withdrawn on May 31, 2025. NASA operates with four FY2022 strategic goals. NASA budget requests are developed by NASA and approved by the administration prior to submission to theUS Congress. Authorized budgets are those that have been included in enacted appropriations bills that are approved by both houses of Congress and enacted into law by the US president. NASA fiscal year budget requests and authorized budgets are listed below. NASA funding and priorities are developed through its six Mission Directorates. Center-wide activities such as the Chief Engineer and Safety and Mission Assurance organizations are aligned to the headquarters function. The MSD budget estimate includes funds for these HQ functions. The administration operates 10 major field centers with several managing additional subordinate facilities across the country. Each center is led by a director (data below valid as of December 23, 2024). The exhaust gases produced by rocket propulsion systems, both in Earth's atmosphere and in space, can adversely affect the Earth's environment. Somehypergolicrocket propellants, such ashydrazine, are highly toxic prior tocombustion, but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning. Rockets using hydrocarbon fuels, such askerosene, release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust.Carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources; on average, the United States consumed 803 million US gal (3.0 million m3) of liquid fuels per day in 2014, while a singleFalcon 9rocket first stage burns around 25,000 US gallons (95 m3) of kerosene fuel per launch.Even if a Falcon 9 were launched every single day, it would only represent 0.006% of liquid fuel consumption (and carbon dioxide emissions) for that day. Additionally, the exhaust fromLOx- andLH2- fueled engines, like theSSME, is almost entirely water vapor.NASA addressed environmental concerns with its canceledConstellation programin accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act in 2011.In contrast,ion enginesuse harmless noble gases likexenonfor propulsion. An example of NASA's environmental efforts is theNASA Sustainability Base. Additionally, the Exploration Sciences Building was awarded the LEED Gold rating in 2010.On May 8, 2003, theEnvironmental Protection Agencyrecognized NASA as the first federal agency to directly uselandfill gasto produce energy at one of its facilities—theGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. In 2018, NASA along with other companies including Sensor Coating Systems,Pratt & Whitney, Monitor Coating andUTRClaunched the project CAUTION (CoAtings for Ultra High Temperature detectION). This project aims to enhance the temperature range of theThermal History Coatingup to 1,500 °C (2,730 °F) and beyond. The final goal of this project is improving the safety of jet engines as well as increasing efficiency and reducing CO2emissions. NASA also researches and publishes onclimate change.Its statements concur with the global scientific consensus that the climate is warming.Bob Walker, who has advised former US PresidentDonald Trumpon space issues, has advocated that NASA should focus on space exploration and that its climate study operations should be transferred to other agencies such asNOAA. Former NASA atmospheric scientistJ. Marshall Shepherdcountered that Earth science study was built into NASA's mission atits creationin the 1958National Aeronautics and Space Act.NASA won the2020 Webby People's Voice Award for Greenin the category Web. Educational Launch of Nanosatellites(ELaNa). Since 2011, the ELaNa program has provided opportunities for NASA to work with university teams to test emerging technologies and commercial-off-the-shelf solutions by providing launch opportunities for developedCubeSatsusing NASA procured launch opportunities.By example, two NASA-sponsoredCubeSatslaunched in June 2022 on aVirgin OrbitLauncherOnevehicle as the ELaNa 39 mission. Cubes in Space. NASA started an annual competition in 2014 named "Cubes in Space".It is jointly organized by NASA and the global education companyI Doodle Learning, with the objective of teaching school students aged 11–18 to design and build scientific experiments to be launched into space on a NASA rocket or balloon. On June 21, 2017, the world's smallest satellite, KalamSAT, was launched. US law requires theInternational System of Unitsto be used in all US Government programs, "except where impractical". In 1969,Apollo 11landed on the Moon using a mix ofUnited States customary unitsandmetric units. In the 1980s, NASA started the transition towards the metric system, but was still using both systems in the 1990s.On September 23, 1999, a mixup between NASA's use of SI units andLockheed Martin Space's use of US units resulted in the loss of theMars Climate Orbiter. In August 2007, NASA stated that all future missions and explorations of the Moon would be done entirely using the SI system. This was done to improve cooperation with space agencies of other countries that already use the metric system.As of 2007, NASA is predominantly working with SI units, but some projects still use US units, and some, including the International Space Station, use a mix of both. Approaching 40 years of service, theNASA TVchannel airs content ranging from live coverage of crewed missions to video coverage of significant milestones for operating robotic spacecraft (e.g. rover landings on Mars) and domestic and international launches.The channel is delivered by NASA and is broadcast by satellite and over the Internet. The system initially started to capture archival footage of important space events for NASA managers and engineers and expanded as public interest grew. TheApollo 8Christmas Eve broadcast while in orbit around the Moon was received by more than a billion people.NASA's video transmission of theApollo 11Moon landing was awarded aprimetime Emmyin commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the landing.The channel is a product of the US Government and is widely available across many television and Internet platforms. NASAcast is the official audio and videopodcastof the NASA website. Created in late 2005, the podcast service contains the latest audio and video features from the NASA web site, includingNASA TV'sThis Week at NASAand educational materials produced by NASA. Additional NASA podcasts, such as Science@NASA, are also featured and give subscribers an in-depth look at content by subject matter. NASA EDGE is avideo podcastwhich explores different missions, technologies and projects developed by NASA. The program was released by NASA on March 18, 2007, and, as of August 2020[update], there have been 200 vodcasts produced. It is apublic outreachvodcast sponsored by NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate and based out of the Exploration and Space Operations Directorate atLangley Research CenterinHampton, Virginia. The NASA EDGE team takes an insider's look at current projects and technologies from NASA facilities around the United States, and it is depicted through personal interviews, on-scene broadcasts,computer animations, and personal interviews with top scientists and engineers at NASA.[note 2] The show explores the contributions NASA has made to society as well as the progress of current projects in materials andspace exploration. NASA EDGE vodcasts can be downloaded from the NASA website and fromiTunes. In its first year of production, the show was downloaded over 450,000 times. As of February 2010,[update]the average download rate is more than 420,000 per month, with over one million downloads in December 2009 and January 2010. NASA and the NASA EDGE have also developed interactive programs designed to complement the vodcast. The Lunar Electric Rover App allows users to drive a simulatedLunar Electric Roverbetween objectives, and it provides information about and images of the vehicle.The NASA EDGE Widget provides agraphical user interfacefor accessing NASA EDGE vodcasts, image galleries, and the program's Twitter feed, as well as a live NASA news feed. Astronomy Picture of the Day(APOD) is awebsiteprovided by NASA andMichigan Technological University(MTU). Each day it features a different image of theuniverseaccompanied by an explanation written by a professionalastronomer.The photograph does not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is displayed, and images are sometimes repeated.These often relate to current events in astronomy andspace exploration. The text has several hyperlinks to more pictures and websites for more information. The images are eithervisible spectrumphotographs, images taken at non-visiblewavelengthsand displayed infalse color, video footage, animations, artist's conceptions, ormicrographsthat relate to space or cosmology. In July 2023, NASA announced a newstreaming serviceknown as NASA+. It launched on November 8, 2023, and has live coverage of launches, documentaries and original programs. According to NASA, it will be free of ads and subscription fees. It will be a part of the NASA app oniOS,Android,Amazon Fire TV,RokuandApple TVas well as on the web on desktop and mobile devices.

TheEuropean Space Agency(ESA)[a]is a 23-memberinternational organisationdevoted tospace exploration.It has its headquarters in Paris and a staff of around 2,547 people globally as of 2023.[citation needed]ESA was founded in 1975 in the context ofEuropean integration. Its 2025 annual budget was €7.7 billion. The ESAhuman spaceflightprogramme includes participation in theInternational Space Station(ISS) and collaboration withNASAon theArtemisprogramme, especially manufacturing of theOrionspacecraft'sEuropean Service Module(ESM). ESA launches and operates uncrewed missions to the Moon, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, the Sun, and various comets and asteroids. Other activities includespace telescopes,Earth observation satellites,asteroid impact avoidance,telecommunicationandnavigationsatellites, designinglaunch vehicles(e.g.Ariane 6is operated throughArianespacewith ESA sharing in the costs), and maintaining Europe'sSpaceport(theGuiana Space CentreatKourou, French Guiana), as well as space safety and commercialisation. AfterWorld War II, many European scientists left Western Europe to work with the United States. Although the 1950s boom made it possible for Western European countries to invest in research and specifically in space-related activities, Western European scientists realised solely national projects would not be able to compete with the two main superpowers. In 1958, only months after theSputnik shock,Edoardo Amaldi(Italy) andPierre Auger(France), two prominent members of the Western European scientific community, met to discuss the foundation of a common Western European space agency. The meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries. The Western European nations decided to have two agencies: one concerned with developing a launch system,ELDO(European Launcher Development Organisation), of which Pierre Auger became the first Director General from 1964 to 1967, and the other the precursor of the European Space Agency,ESRO(European Space Research Organisation). The latter was established on 20 March 1964 by an agreement signed on 14 June 1962. From 1968 to 1972, ESRO launched seven research satellites, but ELDO was not able to deliver a launch vehicle. Both agencies struggled with the underfunding and diverging interests of their participants. The ESA in its current form was founded with the ESA Convention in 1975, when ESRO was merged with ELDO. The ESA had ten founding member states: Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.These signed the ESA Convention in 1975 and deposited the instruments of ratification by 1980, when the convention came into force.During this interval the agency functioned in ade factofashion. ESA launched its first major scientific mission in 1975,Cos-B, a satelite monitoringgamma-ray emissionsin the universe, which was first worked on by ESRO.ESA collaborated withNASAon theInternational Ultraviolet Explorer(IUE), the world's first high-orbit telescope, which was launched in 1978 and operated successfully for 18 years.A number of successful Earth-orbit projects followed, and in 1986 ESA beganGiotto, its first deep-space mission, to study the cometsHalleyandGrigg–Skjellerup.Hipparcos, a star-mapping mission, was launched in 1989and in the 1990sSOHO,Ulysses, and theHubble Space Telescopewere all jointly carried out with NASA.Later scientific missions in cooperation with NASA include theCassini–Huygensspace probe, to which the ESA contributed by building theTitanlanding moduleHuygens. As the successor ofELDO, the ESA has also constructed rockets for scientific and commercial payloads.Ariane 1, launched in 1979, carried mostly commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward. The next two versions of the Ariane rocket were intermediate stages in the development of a more advanced launch system, theAriane 4, which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established the ESA as the world leader in commercial space launches in the 1990s.Although the succeedingAriane 5experienced a failure on its first flight in 1996,it has since firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space launch market with 112 successful launches until 2023.In 1998, ESA started developing thesmall-liftlaunch vehicleVega,which has since flown 22 times between 2012 and 2024. The beginning of the new millennium saw the ESA become, along with agencies likeNASAandJAXA, one of the major participants inspace research. Although ESA had relied on co-operation with NASA in previous decades, changed circumstances, such as tough legal restrictions on information sharing underITAR,led to decisions to rely more on itself and on cooperation withRoscosmos. The agency continued its contribution to theInternational Space Station(ISS) programme withEuropean astronautsjoining assembly flights as well aslong-term missionsto the station. In 2008, ESA added its laboratory moduleColumbusto ISS and started launching theATVcargo spacecraft. Notable ESA missions during the 2000s included the agency's firstMoon,Mars, andVenusorbiters:SMART-1,Mars Express, andVenus Express.ESA'sHuygensprobe, launched together with the NASA'sCassinimission in 1997, reached its destination in 2005 when it successfully landed onTitan, marking the farthest landing from Earth a spacecraft has ever made.ThecometorbiterRosettalaunched in 2004 and performed multiple deep space flybys and observations during the decade, but wouldn't reach its destination until 2014. ESA has launched multiple major astronomy missions in the 2000s: thegamma rayobservatoryINTEGRAL,theinfraredobservatoryHerschel, thecosmic microwave backgroundmapperPlanck,andCorot, a milestone in the search forexoplanets.NotableEarth observationmissions launched during the decade includedEnvisat,Double Star,GOCE,SMOS, and the experimentalPROBA series. ESA also contributed to the meteorological constellationsMeteosatandMetOpand tested technologies for the futureGalileosatellite navigation system with twoGIOVEsatellites. In 2021 the ESA ministerial council agreed to the "Matosinhosmanifesto" which set three priority areas (referred to asaccelerators): 1) space for a green future, 2) a rapid and resilient crisis response, and 3) the protection of space assets, and two further high visibility projects (referred to asinspirators): 1) anicy moonsample return mission and 2)human space exploration.In early 2025, ESA released its "Strategy 2040", a long-term roadmap adopted by the ESA council to define the agency's priorities. After theRussian invason of Ukrainein 2022, the cooperation between ESA andRoscosmoswas mostly severed.This led eg. to a delay in theExoMarsprogrammeand ending ofSoyuz launches from the Guiana Space Centre. In early 2020s, ESA has added two major components to the ISS. TheBartolomeoplatform was connected to theColumbusmodule in 2020 to increase its capacity for external payloads.TheEuropean Robotic Armwas launched in 2021 together with theNaukamodule.ESA continued contributingEuropean astronautsto regularISS expeditions, and also started paying private companies for short-term astronaut flights to the station.ESA also started supporting European companies in developing uncrewedspace capsulesfor resupplying the ISS andfuture space stations,as well as the IndianISROin developing their crewedGaganyaanspacecraft.The ESA-builtEuropean Service Moduleof theOrion spacecraftflew on itsfirst uncrewed test flightaround theMoonin 2022. TheBepiColombomission, launched in 2018, has completed all its ninegravity assistmaneuvers at Earth,Venus, andMercury, in preparation for the planned 2026 insertion into Mercury orbit.TheheliophysicsmissionSolar Orbiter, launched in 2020, continues to perform periodic Venus flybys which gradually increase itsorbital inclination, allowing it to observe theSunfrom outside theSolar system plane.TheJuicemission, launched in 2023, has so far completed two gravity assist maneuvers at Earth andVenuson its way to enter an orbit aroundJupiterin 2031.TheHeramission, launched in 2024 as the first space mission of the optionalSpace Safety Programme, flew byMarsin 2025 on its way to perform a post-impact survey of the asteroidDimorphoswhich had been impacted by NASA'sDouble Asteroid Redirection Testmission. Two European orbiters,Mars ExpressandTGO, continued their operations aroundMars, providing scientific insights into the planet's surface and atmosphere. In 2025,Mars Expressreceived a software update, which could allow it to stay operational until 2030s. In the 2020s, ESA started developing a number of space infrastructure projects for long term, sustainable robotic exploration of theMoonandMars. TheArgonautlanders will deliver heavy payloads to the lunar surface.TheMoonlight Initiativewill place a constellation of communication and navigation satellites around the Moon.TheLightShipinterplanetaryspace tugsequipped withsolar electric propulsionwill deliver other spacecraft to Mars and then serve as communication, navigation, and weather satellites within the MARCONI constellation in high Mars orbit. The long-awaitedNASA-ESA-CSAspace telescopeJWSTfinally launched in 2021and started operating in itshalo orbitaround the Sun–EarthL2pointin 2022.The first half of 2023 saw the launch theEuclidspace telescope designed to better understanddark energyanddark matterby accurately measuring theaccelerating expansion of the universe.The experimentalPROBA-3mission, launched in 2024, successfully demonstrated high-precisionformation flyingforcoronagraphyobservation of the Sun. The successor to theVegalaunch vehicle,Vega C, launched successfully for the first time on 13 July 2022, delivering theLARES 2satellite and sixCubeSatsto Earth orbit.The successor to theAriane 5launch vehicle,Ariane 6, had its maiden flight on 9 July 2024, followed by the first commercial launch on 6 March 2025. In March 2025, ESA officially launched itsEuropean Launcher Challenge(ELC) and in July 2025, the agency has preselected five companies for further competition. Initially introduced in November 2023, the program aims to foster new European sovereign launch capabilities, beginning withsmall launch vehiclesand ultimately paving the way for an Ariane 6 successor. The agency's facilities date back to ESRO and are deliberately distributed among various countries and areas. The most important are the following centres: The treaty establishing the European Space Agency reads: Article II, Purpose, Convention of establishment of a European Space Agency, SP-1271(E) from 2003 – The purpose of the Agency shall be to provide for and to promote, for exclusively peaceful purposes, cooperation among European States in space research and technology and their space applications, with a view to their being used for scientific purposes and for operational space applications systems… The ESA is responsible for setting a unified space and related industrial policy, recommending space objectives to the member states, and integrating national programs like satellite development, into the European program as much as possible. Jean-Jacques Dordain– ESA's Director General (2003–2015) – outlined the European Space Agency's mission in a 2003 interview: Today space activities have pursued the benefit of citizens, and citizens are asking for a better quality of life on Earth. They want greater security and economic wealth, but they also want to pursue their dreams, to increase their knowledge, and they want younger people to be attracted to the pursuit of science and technology.
I think that space can do all of this: it can produce a higher quality of life, better security, more economic wealth, and also fulfill our citizens' dreams and thirst for knowledge, and attract the young generation. This is the reason space exploration is an integral part of overall space activities. It has always been so, and it will be even more important in the future. The ESA describes its work in two overlapping ways: These are either mandatory or optional. According to the ESA website, the activities are: Every member country (known as 'Member States') must contribute to these programmes:TheEuropean Space Agency Science Programmeis a long-term programme of space science missions. Depending on their individual choices the countries can contribute to the following programmes, becoming 'Participating States', listed according to: Member states participate to varying degrees with both mandatory space programs and those that are optional. As of 2008[update], the mandatory programmes made up 25% of total expenditures while optional space programmes were the other 75%.The ESA has traditionally implemented a policy of "georeturn", where funds that ESA member states provide to the ESA "are returned in the form of contracts to companies in those countries." By 2015, the ESA was an intergovernmental organisation of 22 member states.The 2008 ESA budget amounted to €3.0 billion whilst the 2009 budget amounted to €3.6 billion.The total budget amounted to about €3.7 billion in 2010, €3.99 billion in 2011, €4.02 billion in 2012, €4.28 billion in 2013, €4.10 billion in 2014, €4.43 billion in 2015, €5.25 billion in 2016, €5.75 billion in 2017, €5.60 billion in 2018, €5.72 billion in 2019, €6.68 billion in 2020, €6.49 billion in 2021, €7.15 billion in 2022, €7.46 billion in 2023 and €7.79 billion in 2024. English and French are the two official languages of the ESA.Additionally, official documents are also provided in German and documents regarding theSpacelabhave been also provided in Italian. If found appropriate, the agency may conduct its correspondence in any language of a member state. The following table lists all the member states and adjunct members, their ESA convention ratification dates, and their contributions as of 2024: Previously associated members were Austria, Norway, Finland and Slovenia, all of which later joined the ESA as full members. Since January 2025 there have been four associate members: Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Canada. The three European members have shown interest in full membership and may eventually apply within the next years. Latvia became the second current associated member on 30 June 2020, when the Association Agreement was signed by ESA Director Jan Wörner and theMinister of Education and Science of Latvia,Ilga ŠuplinskainRiga. TheSaeimaratified it on 27 July. In May 2021, Lithuania became the third current associated member.As a consequence its citizens became eligible to apply to the2022 ESA Astronaut group, applications for which were scheduled to close one week later. The deadline was therefore extended by three weeks to allow Lithuanians a fair chance to apply. Slovakia's Associate membership came into effect on 13 October 2022, for an initial duration of seven years. The Association Agreement supersedes the European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement, which entered into force upon Slovakia's subscription to the Plan for European Cooperating States Charter on 4 February 2016, a scheme introduced at ESA in 2001. The ECS Agreement was subsequently extended until 3 August 2022. Cyprus has signed an Associate Agreement in October 2025, with expectations of becoming an associate member in the coming months. Since 1 January 1979, Canada has had the special status of a Cooperating State within the ESA. By virtue of this accord, theCanadian Space Agencytakes part in the ESA's deliberative bodies and decision-making and also in the ESA's programmes and activities. Canadian firms can bid for and receive contracts to work on programmes. The accord has a provision ensuring a fair industrial return to Canada.The most recent Cooperation Agreement was signed on 15 December 2010 with a term extending to 2020.For 2014, Canada's annual assessed contribution to the ESA general budget was €6,059,449 (CAD$8,559,050).For 2017, Canada has increased its annual contribution to €21,600,000 (CAD$30,000,000). The ESA is funded from annual contributions by national governments of members as well as from an annual contribution by the European Union (EU). The budget of the ESA was €5.250 billion in 2016.Every 3–4 years, ESA member states agree on a budget plan for several years at an ESA member states conference. This plan can be amended in future years, however provides the major guideline for the ESA for several years.[citation needed]The 2016 budget allocations for major areas of the ESA activity are shown in the chart on the right. Countries typically have their own space programmes that differ in how they operate organisationally and financially with the ESA. For example, the French space agency CNES has a total budget of €2,015 million, of which €755 million is paid as direct financial contribution to the ESA.Several space-related projects are joint projects between national space agencies and the ESA (e.g.COROT). Also, the ESA is not the only European governmental space organisation (for exampleEuropean Union Satellite Centreand theEuropean Union Space Programme Agency). After the decision of the ESA Council of 21/22 March 2001, the procedure for accession of the European states was detailed as described the document titled "The Plan for European Co-operating States (PECS)".Nations that want to become a full member of the ESA do so in 3 stages. First a Cooperation Agreement is signed between the country and ESA. In this stage, the country has very limited financial responsibilities. If a country wants to co-operate more fully with ESA, it signs a European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement, albeit to be a candidate for said agreement, a country must be European. The ECS Agreement makes companies based in the country eligible for participation in ESA procurements. The country can also participate in all ESA programmes, except for the Basic Technology Research Programme. While the financial contribution of the country concerned increases, it is still much lower than that of a full member state. The agreement is normally followed by a Plan For European Cooperating State (or PECS Charter). This is a 5-year programme of basicresearch and developmentactivities aimed at improving the nation'sspace industrycapacity. At the end of the 5-year period, the country can either begin negotiations to become a full member state or an associated state or sign a new PECS Charter.Many countries, most of which joined the EU in both 2004 and 2007, have started to co-operate with the ESA on various levels: During the Ministerial Meeting in December 2014, ESA ministers approved a resolution calling for discussions to begin with Israel, Australia and South Africa on future association agreements. The ministers noted that "concrete cooperation is at an advanced stage" with these nations and that "prospects for mutual benefits are existing". A separate space exploration strategy resolution calls for further co-operation with the United States, Russia and China on "LEOexploration, including a continuation ofISScooperation and the development of a robust plan for the coordinated use of space transportation vehicles and systems for exploration purposes, participation in robotic missions for the exploration of the Moon, the robotic exploration of Mars, leading to a broad Mars Sample Return mission in which Europe should be involved as a full partner, and human missions beyond LEO in the longer term." In August 2019, the ESA and theAustralian Space Agencysigned a joint statement of intent "to explore deeper cooperation and identify projects in a range of areas including deep space, communications, navigation, remote asset management,data analyticsand mission support."Details of the cooperation were laid out in aframework agreementsigned by the two entities. On 17 November 2020, ESA signed amemorandum of understanding(MOU) with theSouth African National Space Agency(SANSA). SANSA CEO Dr. Valanathan Munsami tweeted: "Today saw another landmark event for SANSA with the signing of an MoU with the ESA. This builds on initiatives that we have been discussing for a while already and which gives effect to these. Thanks Jan for your hand of friendship and making this possible." The ESA currently has two operational launch vehiclesVega CandAriane 6.Rocket launches are carried out byArianespace, which has 23 shareholders representing the industry that manufactures the Ariane 5 as well asCNES, at the ESA'sGuiana Space Centre. Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches fromFrench Guianaare able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higherlatitudes. In addition, equatorial launches givespacecraftan extra 'push' of nearly 500 m/s due to the higherrotational velocityof the Earth at the equator compared to near the Earth's poles where rotational velocity approaches zero. Ariane 6 is aheavy liftexpendable launch vehicledeveloped byArianespace. The Ariane 6 entered into its inaugural flight campaign on 26 April 2024 with the flight conducted on 9 July 2024. Vega is the ESA's carrier for small satellites. Developed by seven ESA members led byItaly. It is capable of carrying a payload with a mass of between 300 and 1500 kg to an altitude of 700 km, for lowpolar orbit. Its maiden launch fromKourouwas on 13 February 2012.Vega began full commercial exploitation in December 2015. The rocket has three solid propulsion stages and aliquid propulsionupper stage(theAVUM) for accurate orbital insertion and the ability to place multiplepayloadsinto different orbits. A larger version of the Vega launcher,Vega-Chad its first flight in July 2022.The new evolution of the rocket incorporates a larger first stage booster, theP120Creplacing theP80, an upgradedZefiro (rocket stage)second stage, and the AVUM+ upper stage. This new variant enables larger single payloads, dual payloads, return missions, and orbital transfer capabilities. Historically, the Ariane family rockets have been funded primarily "with money contributed by ESA governments seeking to participate in the program rather than through competitive industry bids. This [has meant that] governments commit multiyear funding to the development with the expectation of a roughly 90% return on investment in the form of industrial workshare." ESA is proposing changes to this scheme by moving tocompetitivebids for the development of theAriane 6. Future projects under development within theFuture Launchers Preparatory Programme (FLPP)include thePrometheusreusable engine technology demonstrator, Phoebus (an upgraded second stage forAriane 6), andThemis(a reusable first stage). At the time the ESA was formed, its main goals did not encompass human space flight; rather it considered itself to be primarily a scientific research organisation for uncrewed space exploration in contrast to its American and Soviet counterparts. It is therefore not surprising that the first non-Soviet European in space was not an ESA astronaut on a European space craft; it wasCzechoslovakVladimír Remekwho in 1978 became the first non-Soviet or American in space (the first man in space beingYuri Gagarinof the Soviet Union) – on aSovietSoyuz spacecraft, followed by thePoleMirosław Hermaszewskiand East GermanSigmund Jähnin the same year. This Soviet co-operation programme, known asIntercosmos, primarily involved the participation ofEastern bloccountries. In 1982, however,Jean-Loup Chrétienbecame the firstnon-Communist Blocastronaut on a flight to the SovietSalyut 7space station. Because Chrétien did not officially fly into space as an ESA astronaut, but rather as a member of the FrenchCNESastronaut corps, the GermanUlf Merboldis considered the first ESA astronaut to fly into space. He participated in theSTS-9Space Shuttlemission that included the first use of the European-builtSpacelabin 1983. STS-9 marked the beginning of an extensive ESA/NASA joint partnership that included dozens of space flights of ESA astronauts in the following years. Some of these missions with Spacelab were fully funded and organisationally and scientifically controlled by the ESA (such as two missions by Germany and one by Japan) with European astronauts as full crew members rather than guests on board. Beside paying for Spacelab flights and seats on the shuttles, the ESA continued its human space flight co-operation with theSoviet Unionand later Russia, including numerous visits toMir. During the latter half of the 1980s, European human space flights changed from being the exception to routine and therefore, in 1990, theEuropean Astronaut CentreinCologne, Germany was established. It selects and trains prospective astronauts and is responsible for the co-ordination with international partners, especially with regard to theInternational Space Station. As of 2006, the ESA astronaut corps officially included twelve members, including nationals from most large European countries except the United Kingdom. In 2008, the ESA started to recruit new astronauts so that final selection would be due in spring 2009. Almost 10,000 people registered as astronaut candidates before registration ended in June 2008. 8,413 fulfilled the initial application criteria. Of the applicants, 918 were chosen to take part in the first stage of psychological testing, which narrowed down the field to 192. After two-stage psychological tests and medical evaluation in early 2009, as well as formal interviews, six new members of theEuropean Astronaut Corpswere selected – five men and one woman. In the 1980s, France pressed for an independent European crew launch vehicle. Around 1978, it was decided to pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in November 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name ofHermeswas introduced. The craft was comparable to early proposals for theSpace Shuttleand consisted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments. With a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on theAriane 5rocket, which was being developed at that time. It was planned solely for use inlow Earth orbitspace flights. The planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991; the production phase was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly. With the fall of theSoviet Union, the ESA looked forward to co-operation with Russia to build a next-generation space vehicle. Thus the Hermes programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent. TheColumbus space station programmehad a similar fate. In the 21st century, ESA started new programmes to create its own crew vehicles, most notable among its various projects and proposals isHopper, whose prototype byEADS, calledPhoenix, has already been tested. While projects such asHopperare neither concrete nor to be realised within the next decade, other possibilities for human spaceflight in co-operation with theRussian Space Agencyhave emerged. Following talks with theRussian Space Agencyin 2004 and June 2005,a co-operation between the ESA and theRussian Space Agencywas announced to jointly work on the Russian-designedKliper, a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond LEO (e.g. the moon or even Mars). It was speculated that Europe would finance part of it. A€50 million participation study for Kliper, which was expected to be approved in December 2005, was finally not approved by ESA member states. The Russian state tender for the project was subsequently cancelled in 2006. In June 2006, ESA member states granted 15 million to theCrew Space Transportation System(CSTS) study, a two-year study to design a spacecraft capable of going beyond Low-Earth orbit based on the currentSoyuzdesign. This project was pursued withRoskosmosinstead of the cancelled Kliper proposal. A decision on the actual implementation and construction of the CSTS spacecraft was contemplated for 2008. In mid-2009 EADS Astrium was awarded a €21 million study into designing a crew vehicle based on the European ATV which was believed to be the basis of the Advanced Crew Transportation System design.Neither of these projects was pursued further in the 2010s. In November 2012, ESA decided to join NASA'sOrion programme. The ATV would form the basis of theEuropean Service Module (ESM)for NASA's new crewed spacecraft. ESA may also seek to work with NASA on Orion's launch system as well to secure a seat on the spacecraft for its own astronauts.The completeOrionwith ESM flew on its first mission to Lunar orbit in 2022. In September 2014, the ESA signed an agreement withSierra Nevada Corporationfor co-operation inDream Chaserproject. Further studies on the Dream Chaser for European Use orDC4EUproject were funded, including the feasibility of launching a Europeanised Dream Chaser onboard Ariane 5. With regard to theInternational Space Station(ISS), the ESA is not represented by all of its member states:11 of the 22 ESA member states currently participate in the project: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Austria, Finland and Ireland chose not to participate, because of lack of interest or concerns about the expense of the project. Portugal, Luxembourg, Greece, the Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, Estonia and Hungary joined ESA after the agreement had been signed. The ESA takes part in the construction and operation of theISS, with contributions such asColumbus, a science laboratory module that was brought into orbit by NASA'sSTS-122Space Shuttlemission, and theCupolaobservatory module that was completed in July 2005 byAlenia Spaziofor the ESA. The current estimates for the ISS are approaching €100 billion in total (development, construction and 10 years of maintaining the station) of which the ESA has committed to paying €8 billion.About 90% of the costs of the ESA's ISS share will be contributed by Germany (41%), France (28%) and Italy (20%). German ESA astronautThomas Reiterwas the first long-term ISS crew member. The ESA has developed theAutomated Transfer Vehiclefor ISS resupply. Each ATV has a cargo capacity of 7,667 kilograms (16,903 lb).The first ATV,Jules Verne, was launched on 9 March 2008 and on 3 April 2008 successfully docked with the ISS. This manoeuvre, considered a major technical feat, involved using automated systems to allow the ATV to track the ISS, moving at 27,000 km/h, and attach itself with an accuracy of 2 cm. Five vehicles were launched before the program ended with the launch of the fifth ATV,Georges Lemaître, in 2014. As of 2020, the spacecraft establishing supply links to the ISS are the RussianProgressandSoyuz, JapaneseKounotori (HTV), and the United States vehiclesCargo Dragon 2andCygnusstemmed from theCommercial Resupply Servicesprogram. European Life and Physical Sciences research on board the International Space Station (ISS) is mainly based on theEuropean Programme for Life and Physical Sciences in Spaceprogramme that was initiated in 2001. Since 2015, ESA has launched numerousCubeSat-typesmall satellitessupported through various programmes: GSTP also supports other non-CubeSatsmall satellitemissions, e.g. thePROBA series. The InCubed co-funding programme, managed by ESA'sΦ-lab,supports innovative technologies forEarth observation satellities. IOD/IOV is aEuropean Unionprogramme entrusted to ESA. The ESA has signed co-operation agreements with the following states that currently neither plan to integrate as tightly with ESA institutions as Canada, nor envision future membership of the ESA: Argentina,Brazil,China,India,Russia,and Turkey.Additionally, the ESA has joint projects with theEUSPAof the European Union,NASAof the United States and is participating in theInternational Space Stationtogether with the United States (NASA), Russia, and Japan (JAXA). The ESA has a long history of collaboration withNASA. Since ESA's astronaut corps was formed, theSpace Shuttlehas been the primary launch vehicle used by the ESA's astronauts to get into space through partnership programmes with NASA. In the 1980s and 1990s, theSpacelabprogramme was an ESA-NASA joint research programme that had the ESA develop and manufacture orbital labs for the Space Shuttle for several flights in which the ESA participates with astronauts in experiments. In robotic science mission and exploration missions, NASA has been the ESA's main partner.Cassini–Huygenswas a joint NASA-ESA mission, along with theInfrared Space Observatory,INTEGRAL,SOHO, and others. Also, theHubble Space Telescopeis a joint project of NASA and the ESA. Future ESA-NASA joint projects include theJames Webb Space Telescopeand the proposedLaser Interferometer Space Antenna.[citation needed]NASA has supported the ESA'sMarcoPolo-Rmission which landed on asteroid Bennu in October 2020 and is scheduled to return a sample to Earth for further analysis in 2023.NASA and the ESA will also likely join for aMars sample-return mission.In October 2020, the ESA entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with NASA to work together on theArtemis program, which will provide an orbitingLunar Gatewayand also accomplish the first crewed lunar landing in 50 years, whose team will include thefirst woman on the Moon. Astronaut selection announcements are expected within two years of the 2024 scheduled launch date.ESA also purchases seats on the NASA operatedCommercial Crew Program. The first ESA astronaut to be on a Commercial Crew Program mission isThomas Pesquet. Pesquet launched into space aboardCrew DragonEndeavouron theCrew-2mission. The ESA also has seats onCrew-3withMatthias MaurerandCrew-4withSamantha Cristoforetti. ESA and theJapanese Space Agency(JAXA) have engaged in long-standing collaboration in various domains of space exploration, satellite technology, space science, and human spaceflight. Their partnership has evolved over the decades, focusing on joint missions, technology sharing, and international cooperation in space exploration.Some of the programs includeBepiColombo Mission,EarthCAREandComet Interceptor. In 2004 ESA entered into a major collaboration with theRussian Space Agency(Roscosmos) in the form of theCSTS, the preparation ofFrench Guianaspaceport for launches ofSoyuz-2rockets, theSchiaparellidemonstration lander and theTrace Gas Orbiter.In 2022, all collaboration with the Russian Space Agency was terminated after Russianinvasion of Ukraine. Since China has invested more money into space activities, theChinese Space Agency(CNSA) has sought international partnerships. ESA is one of its most important partners. Both space agencies cooperated in the development of theDouble Star Mission.In 2017, the ESA sent two astronauts to China for two weeks sea survival training with Chinese astronauts inYantai, Shandong.In 2024, theEinstein Probewas launched.In 2025 theSMILEmission will image for the first time the magnetosphere of the Sun in soft X-rays and UV during up to 40 hours per orbit. With India, the ESA agreed to send instruments into space aboard theIndian Space Agency(ISRO)Chandrayaan-1in 2008. In 2023, following the successful launch of theEuclid telescopein July on aFalcon 9rocket, the ESA approachedSpaceXto launch fourGalileo communication satelliteson two Falcon 9 rockets in 2024; however, it would require approval from the European Commission and all member states of the European Union to proceed. The ESA is an independent space agency and not under the jurisdiction of the European Union, although they have common goals, share funding, and work together often.The initial aim of the European Union (EU) was to make the European Space Agency anagency of the EUby 2014.While the EU and its member states fund together 86% of the budget of the ESA, it is not anEU agency. Furthermore, the ESA has several non-EU members, most notably the United Kingdom whichleft the EUwhile remaining a full member of the ESA. The ESA is partnered with the EU on its two current flagship space programmes, theCopernicus series of Earth observation satellitesand theGalileo satellite navigation system, with the ESA providing technical oversight and, in the case of Copernicus, some of the funding.The EU, though, has shown an interest in expanding into new areas, whence the proposal to rename and expand its satellite navigation agency (theEuropean GNSS Agency) into the EU Agency for the Space Programme. The proposal drew strong criticism from the ESA, as it was perceived as encroaching on the ESA's turf. In January 2021, after years of acrimonious relations, EU and ESA officials mended their relationship, with the EU Internal Market commissionerThierry Bretonsaying "The European space policy will continue to rely on the ESA and its unique technical, engineering and science expertise," and that the "ESA will continue to be the European agency for space matters.If we are to be successful in our European strategy for space, and we will be, I will need the ESA by my side." ESA director Aschbacher reciprocated, saying "I would really like to make the ESA the main agency, the go-to agency of the European Commission for all its flagship programmes." The ESA andEUSPAare now seen to have distinct roles and competencies, which will be officialised in the Financial Framework Partnership Agreement (FFPA).Whereas the ESA's focus will be on the technical elements of the EU space programmes, theEUSPAwill handle the operational elements of those programmes. As of 2023, Many other facilities are operated by national space agencies in close collaboration with the ESA. The ESA employs around 2,547 people, and thousands of contractors. Initially, new employees are contracted for an expandable four-year term, which is until the organisation's retirement age of 63. According to the ESA's documents, the staff can receive myriad of perks, such as financial childcare support, retirement plans, and financial help when migrating. The ESA also prevents employees from disclosing any private documents or correspondences to outside parties.Ars Technica's 2023 report, which contained testimonies of 18 people, suggested that there is a widespread harassment between management and its employees, especially with its contractors. Since the ESA is an international organisation, unaffiliated with any single nation, any form of legal action is difficult to raise against the organisation. On 3 August 1984, the ESA's Paris headquarters were severely damaged and six people were hurt when a bomb exploded. It was planted by the far-left armedAction Directegroup. On 14 December 2015, hackers fromAnonymousbreached the ESA's subdomains and leaked thousands of login credentials.

Arianeis a series of European civilianexpendable launch vehiclesfor space launch use. The name comes from the French spelling of the mythological characterAriadne. France first proposed theAriane projectand it was officially agreed upon at the end of 1973 after discussions between France, Germany and the UK. The project was Western Europe's second attempt at developing its own launcher following the unsuccessfulEuropaproject. The Ariane project was code-namedL3S(the French abbreviation for third-generation substitution launcher). TheEuropean Space Agency(ESA) chargedAérospatiale(whose former assets now formAirbus) with the development of all Ariane launchers and of the testing facilities, whileArianespacehandled production, operations and marketing after its creation in 1980. Arianespace launches Arianerocketsfrom theGuiana Space CentreatKourouinFrench Guiana. As a result of the merger in 2000 that founded Airbus, the new corporation'sspace branchand subsequently its subsidiary withSafran,ArianeGroup, took over the duties of the defunct Aérospatiale. Ariane 1 was a three-stage launcher, derived frommissiletechnology. The first two stages usedhypergolic propellantsand the third stage usedcryogenicliquid hydrogenandliquid oxygen(LH2/LOX). Ariane 2–4 were enhancements of the basic vehicle. The major differences are improved versions of theengines, allowing stretched first- and third-stage tanks and greater payloads. The largest versions can launch twosatellites, mounted in theSPELDA(Structure Porteuse Externe pour Lancements Doubles Ariane) adapter. Such later versions are often seen with strap-onboosters. These layouts are designated by suffixes after the generation number. First is the total number of boosters, then letters designatingliquid- orsolid-fuelledstages. For example, an Ariane 42P is an Ariane 4 with two solid-fuel boosters. An Ariane 44LP has two solid, two liquid boosters, and a 44L has four liquid-fuel boosters. Ariane 5 is a nearly complete redesign. The two hypergolic lower stages are replaced with a single LH2/LOX core stage. This simplifies the stack, along with the use of a single core engine (Vulcain). Because the core cannot lift its own weight, two solid-fuel boosters are strapped to the sides. The boosters can be recovered for examination, but are not reused. There are two versions of the upper stage, one hypergolic and restartable with a singleAestusengineand the other with aHM7Bcryogenic engine burning LH2/LOX. On 4 May 2007, an Ariane 5-ECA rocket set a new commercial payload record, lifting two satellites with a combined mass of 9.4 tonnes. By January 2006, 169 Ariane flights had boosted 290 satellites, successfully placing 271 of them on orbit (223 main passengers and 48 auxiliary passengers) for a total mass of 575,000 kg successfully delivered on orbit.[citation needed]Attesting to the ubiquity of Ariane launch vehicles, France'sCerise satellite, which was orbited by an Ariane 4 in 1995,struck a discarded Ariane rocket stage in 1996.The incident marked the first verified case of a collision with a piece of cataloguedspace debris. On February 16, 2011, the 200th Ariane rocket was launched, successfully carrying theJohannes Kepler ATVintolow Earth orbitand providingInternational Space Stationwith supplies. On November 26, 2019, flight number 250 was performed, lifting twocommunications satellites:TIBA-1andInmarsat-5F5 (GX5). On December 25, 2021,Ariane flight VA256lifted NASA'sJames Webb Space Telescopetowards Earth/SunLagrange pointL2. Ariane 5 flew its final mission on 5 July 2023. Ariane Nextis In early development, due for launch from the 2030s.

TheSpitzer Space Telescope, formerly theSpace Infrared Telescope Facility(SIRTF), was aninfraredspace telescopelaunched in 2003, that was deactivated when operations ended on 30 January 2020.Spitzer was the third space telescope dedicated to infrared astronomy, followingIRAS(1983) andISO(1995–1998). It was the first spacecraft to use anEarth-trailing orbit, later used by theKeplerplanet-finder. The planned mission period was to be 2.5 years with a pre-launch expectation that the mission could extend to five or slightly more years until the onboardliquid heliumsupply was exhausted. This occurred on 15 May 2009.Without liquid helium to cool the telescope to the very low temperatures needed to operate, most of the instruments were no longer usable. However, the two shortest-wavelength modules of theIRACcamera continued to operate with the same sensitivity as before the helium was exhausted, and continued to be used into early 2020 in theSpitzer Warm Mission. During the warm mission, the two short wavelength channels of IRAC operated at 28.7 K and were predicted to experience little to no degradation at this temperature compared to the nominal mission. The Spitzer data, from both the primary and warm phases, are archived at theInfrared Science Archive(IRSA). In keeping with NASA tradition, the telescope was renamed after its successful demonstration of operation, on 18 December 2003. Unlike mosttelescopesthat are named by a board of scientists, typically after famous deceased astronomers, the new name for SIRTF was obtained from a contest open to the general public.
The contest led to the telescope being named in honor of astronomerLyman Spitzer, who had promoted the concept of space telescopes in the 1940s.Spitzer wrote a 1946 report forRAND Corporationdescribing the advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory and how it could be realized with available or upcoming technology.He has been cited for his pioneering contributions torocketryandastronomy, as well as "his vision and leadership in articulating the advantages and benefits to be realized from the Space Telescope Program." TheUS$776 millionSpitzer was launched on 25 August 2003 at 05:35:39UTCfromCape CanaveralSLC-17Baboard aDelta II7920H rocket.It was placed into aheliocentric(as opposed to ageocentric) orbit trailing and drifting away from Earth's orbit at approximately 0.1astronomical unitsper year (an"Earth-trailing" orbit). Theprimary mirroris 85 centimeters (33 in) in diameter,f/12, made ofberylliumand was cooled to 5.5K(−268 °C; −450 °F). Thesatellitecontains three instruments that allowed it to perform astronomical imaging andphotometryfrom 3.6 to 160 micrometers,spectroscopyfrom 5.2 to 38 micrometers, andspectrophotometryfrom 55 to 95 micrometers. By the early 1970s, astronomers began to consider the possibility of placing aninfrared telescopeabove the obscuring effects of Earth's atmosphere. Most of the infrared spectrum is outside theoptical window, meaning they are strongly absorbed by the atmosphere, except for theinfrared window. In 1979, a report from the National Research Council of theNational Academy of Sciences,A Strategy for Space Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 1980s, identified a Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF)as "one of two major astrophysics facilities [to be developed] forSpacelab", a shuttle-borne platform. Anticipating the major results from an upcoming Explorer satellite and from the Shuttle mission, the report also favored the "study and development of ... long-duration spaceflights of infrared telescopes cooled to cryogenic temperatures." The launch in January 1983 of theInfrared Astronomical Satellite(IRAS), jointly developed by the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, to conduct the first far-infrared survey of the sky, whetted the appetites of scientists worldwide for follow-up space missions capitalizing on the rapid improvements in infrared detector technology. Earlier infrared observations had been made by both space-based and ground-basedobservatories. Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infraredwavelengthsorfrequencies, both the Earth'satmosphereand the telescope itself will radiate (glow) brightly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths. This necessitates lengthy exposure times and greatly decreases the ability to detect faint objects. It could be compared to trying to observe the stars in visible light at noon from a telescope built out of light bulbs. Previous space observatories (such asIRAS, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, andISO, the Infrared Space Observatory) were launched during the 1980s and 1990s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then. Most of the early concepts envisioned repeated flights aboard the NASA Space Shuttle. This approach was developed in an era when the Shuttle program was expected to support weekly flights of up to 30 days duration. A May 1983 NASA Announcement of Opportunity described SIRTF as a Shuttle-attached mission with an evolving scientific instrument payload. Several flights were anticipated with a probable transition into a more extended mode of operation, possibly in association with a future space platform or space station. SIRTF would be a 1-meter class, cryogenically cooled, multi-user facility consisting of a telescope and associated focal plane instruments mounted on a general-purpose Instrument Pointing System to be developed byNASA Ames. SIRTF would be launched on the Space Shuttle and remain attached to the Shuttle as aSpacelabpayload during astronomical observations, after which it would be returned to Earth for refurbishment prior to re-flight. The first flight was expected to occur about 1990 with the succeeding flights anticipated beginning approximately one year later. However, the Spacelab-2 flight aboardSTS-51-Fshowed that the Shuttle environment was poorly suited to an onboard infrared telescope due to contamination from the relatively "dirty" vacuum associated with the orbiters. By September 1983, NASA was considering the "possibility of a long duration [free-flyer] SIRTF mission". Spitzer is the only one of theGreat Observatoriesnot launched by theSpace Shuttle, as was originally intended[citation needed]. However, after the 1986Challenger disaster, theShuttle-Centaurupper stage, which would have been required to place it into its final orbit, was abandoned. The mission underwent a series of redesigns during the 1990s, primarily due to budget considerations. This resulted in a much smaller but still fully capable mission that could use the smaller Delta II expendable launch vehicle. One of the most important advances of this redesign was anEarth-trailing orbit.Cryogenic satellites that require liquid helium (LHe, T ≈ 4 K) temperatures in near-Earth orbit are typically exposed to a large heat load from Earth, and consequently require large amounts of LHe coolant, which then tends to dominate the total payload mass and limits mission life. Placing the satellite in solar orbit far from Earth allowed innovative passive cooling. The sun shield protected the rest of the spacecraft from the Sun's heat, the far side of the spacecraft was painted black to enhance passive radiation of heat, and the spacecraft bus was thermally isolated from the telescope. All of these design choices combined to drastically reduce the total mass of helium needed, resulting in an overall smaller and lighter payload, resulting in major cost savings, but with a mirror the same diameter as originally designed. This orbit also simplified telescope pointing, but did require theNASA Deep Space Networkfor communications.[citation needed] The primary instrument package (telescope and cryogenic chamber) was developed byBall Aerospace & Technologies, inBoulder, Colorado. The individual instruments were developed jointly by industrial, academic, and government institutions. The principals wereCornell University, theUniversity of Arizona, theSmithsonian Astrophysical Observatory,Ball Aerospace, andGoddard Spaceflight Center. The shorter-wavelength infrared detectors were developed byRaytheoninGoleta, California. Raytheon usedindium antimonideand adopedsilicondetector in the creation of the infrared detectors. These detectors are 100 times more sensitive than what was available at the beginning of the project during the 1980s.The far-infrared detectors (70–160 micrometers) were developed jointly by the University of Arizona andLawrence Berkeley National Laboratoryusinggallium-dopedgermanium. The spacecraft was built byLockheed Martin. The mission was operated and managed by theJet Propulsion Laboratoryand theSpitzer Science Center,located at IPAC on theCaltechcampus in Pasadena, California.[citation needed] Spitzer ran out of liquid helium coolant on 15 May 2009, which stopped far-IR observations. Only the IRAC instrument remained in use, and only at the two shorter wavelength bands (3.6 μm and 4.5 μm). The telescope equilibrium temperature was then around 30 K (−243 °C; −406 °F), and IRAC continued to produce valuable images at those wavelengths as the "Spitzer Warm Mission". Late in the mission, ~2016, Spitzer's distance to Earth and the shape of its orbit meant the spacecraft had to pitch over at an extreme angle to aim its antenna at Earth.The solar panels were not fully illuminated at this angle, and this limited those communications to 2.5 hours due to the battery drain.The telescope was retired on 30 January 2020when NASA sent a shutdown signal to the telescope from theGoldstone Deep Space Communications Complex(GDSCC) instructing the telescope to go into safe mode.After receiving confirmation that the command was successful, Spitzer Project Manager Joseph Hunt officially declared that the mission had ended. Spitzer carries three instruments on board: All three instruments used liquid helium for cooling the sensors. Once the helium was exhausted, only the two shorter wavelengths in IRAC were used in the "warm mission". While some time on the telescope was reserved for participating institutions and crucial projects, astronomers around the world also had the opportunity to submit proposals for observing time. Prior to launch, there was a proposal call for large, coherent investigations using Spitzer. If the telescope failed early and/or ran out of cryogen very quickly, these so-called Legacy Projects would ensure the best possible science could be obtained quickly in the early months of the mission. As a requirement tied to the funding these Legacy teams received, the teams had to deliver high-level data products back to the Spitzer Science Center (and theNASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive) for use by the community, again ensuring the rapid scientific return of the mission. The international scientific community quickly realized the value of delivering products for others to use, and even though Legacy projects were no longer explicitly solicited in subsequent proposal calls, teams continued to deliver products to the community. The Spitzer Science Center later reinstated named "Legacy" projects (and later still "Exploration Science" projects) in response to this community-driven effort. Important targets included forming stars (young stellar objects, or YSOs), planets, and other galaxies. Images are freely available for educational and journalistic purposes. The first released images from Spitzer were designed to show off the abilities of the telescope and showed a glowing stellar nursery, a big swirling, dustygalaxy, a disc of planet-forming debris, and organic material in the distant universe. Since then, many monthly press releases have highlighted Spitzer'scapabilities, as the NASA andESAimages do for theHubble Space Telescope. As one of its most noteworthy observations, in 2005, Spitzer became one of the first telescopes to directly capture light fromexoplanets, namely the "hot Jupiters"HD 209458 bandTrES-1b, although it did not resolve that light into actual images.This was one of the first times the light from extrasolar planets had been directly detected; earlier observations had been indirectly made by drawing conclusions from behaviors of the stars the planets were orbiting. The telescope also discovered in April 2005 thatCohen-kuhi Tau/4had a planetary disk that was vastly younger and contained less mass than previously theorized, leading to new understandings of how planets are formed. In 2004, it was reported that Spitzer had spotted a faintly glowing body that may be the youngest star ever seen. The telescope was trained on a core of gas and dust known asL1014which had previously appeared completely dark to ground-based observatories and to ISO (Infrared Space Observatory), a predecessor to Spitzer. The advanced technology of Spitzer revealed a bright red hot spot in the middle of L1014. Scientists from theUniversity of Texas at Austin, who discovered the object, believe the hot spot to be an example of early star development, with the young star collecting gas and dust from the cloud around it. Early speculation about the hot spot was that it might have been the faint light of another core that lies 10 times further from Earth but along the same line of sight as L1014. Follow-up observation from ground-based near-infrared observatories detected a faint fan-shaped glow in the same location as the object found by Spitzer. That glow is too feeble to have come from the more distant core, leading to the conclusion that the object is located within L1014. (Younget al., 2004) In 2005, astronomers from theUniversity of WisconsinatMadisonandWhitewaterdetermined, on the basis of 400 hours of observation on the Spitzer Space Telescope, that theMilky Waygalaxy has a more substantialbar structureacross its core than previously recognized. Also in 2005, astronomersAlexander KashlinskyandJohn Matherof NASA'sGoddard Space Flight Centerreported that one of Spitzer'searliest images may have captured the light of the first stars in the universe. An image of aquasarin theDracoconstellation, intended only to helpcalibratethe telescope, was found to contain an infrared glow after the light of known objects was removed. Kashlinsky and Mather are convinced that the numerous blobs in this glow are the light of stars that formed as early as 100 million years after theBig Bang,redshiftedbycosmic expansion. In March 2006, astronomers reported an 80-light-year-long (25pc) nebula near the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, theDouble Helix Nebula, which is, as the name implies, twisted into a double spiral shape. This is thought to be evidence of massive magnetic fields generated by the gas disc orbiting thesupermassive black holeat the galaxy's center, 300 light-years (92 pc) from the nebula and 25,000 light-years (7,700 pc) from Earth. This nebula was discovered by Spitzer and published in the magazineNatureon 16 March 2006. In May 2007, astronomers successfully mapped the atmospheric temperature ofHD 189733 b, thus obtaining the first map of some kind of an extrasolar planet. Starting in September 2006, the telescope participated in a series of surveys called theGould Belt Survey, observing theGould's Beltregion in multiple wavelengths. The first set of observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope was completed from 21 September 2006 through 27 September. Resulting from these observations, the team of astronomers led by Dr. Robert Gutermuth, of theCenter for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonianreported the discovery ofSerpens South, a cluster of 50 young stars in theSerpensconstellation. Scientists have long wondered how tiny silicate crystals, which need high temperatures to form, have found their way into frozen comets, born in the very cold environment of the Solar System's outer edges. The crystals would have begun as non-crystallized, amorphous silicate particles, part of the mix of gas and dust from which the Solar System developed. This mystery has deepened with the results of theStardustsample return mission, which captured particles from CometWild 2. Many of the Stardust particles were found to have formed at temperatures in excess of 1,000 K. In May 2009, Spitzer researchers from Germany, Hungary, and the Netherlands found that amorphous silicate appears to have been transformed into crystalline form by an outburst from a star. They detected the infrared signature offorsteritesilicate crystals on the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star EX Lupi during one of its frequent flare-ups, or outbursts, seen by Spitzer in April 2008. These crystals were not present in Spitzer'sprevious observations of the star's disk during one of its quiet periods. These crystals appear to have formed by radiative heating of the dust within 0.5 AU of EX Lupi. In August 2009, the telescope found evidence of a high-speed collision between two burgeoning planets orbiting a young star. In October 2009, astronomers Anne J. Verbiscer, Michael F. Skrutskie, and Douglas P. Hamilton published findings of the "Phoebe ring" ofSaturn, which was found with the telescope; the ring is a huge, tenuous disc of material extending from 128 to 207 times the radius of Saturn. GLIMPSE, theGalactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire, was a series of surveys that spanned 360° of the inner region of the Milky Way galaxy, which provided the first large-scale mapping of the galaxy.It consists of more than 2 million snapshots taken in four separate wavelengths using the Infrared Array Camera.The images were taken over a 10-year period beginning in 2003 when Spitzer launched. MIPSGAL, a similar survey that complements GLIMPSE, covers 248° of the galactic diskusing the 24 and 70 μm channels of the MIPS instrument. On 3 June 2008, scientists unveiled the largest, most detailed infrared portrait of theMilky Way, created by stitching together more than 800,000 snapshots, at the 212th meeting of theAmerican Astronomical SocietyinSt. Louis,Missouri.This composite survey is now viewable with the GLIMPSE/MIPSGAL Viewer. Spitzer observations, announced in May 2011, indicate that tinyforsteritecrystals might be falling down like rain on to theprotostarHOPS-68. The discovery of the forsterite crystals in the outer collapsing cloud of the protostar is surprising because the crystals form at lava-like high temperatures, yet they are found in the molecular cloud where the temperatures are about −170 °C (103 K; −274 °F). This led the team of astronomers to speculate that thebipolar outflowfrom the young star may be transporting the forsterite crystals from near the star's surface to the chilly outer cloud. In January 2012, it was reported that further analysis of the Spitzer observations of EX Lupi can be understood if the forsterite crystalline dust was moving away from the protostar at a remarkable average speed of 38 kilometres per second (24 mi/s). It would appear that such high speeds can arise only if the dust grains had been ejected by a bipolar outflow close to the star.Such observations are consistent with an astrophysical theory, developed in the early 1990s, where it was suggested that bipolar outflows garden or transform the disks of gas and dust that surround protostars by continually ejecting reprocessed, highly heated material from the inner disk, adjacent to the protostar, to regions of the accretion disk further away from the protostar. In April 2015, Spitzer and theOptical Gravitational Lensing Experimentwere reported as co-discovering one of the most distant planets ever identified: a gas giant about 13,000 light-years (4,000 pc) away from Earth. In June and July 2015, thebrown dwarfOGLE-2015-BLG-1319was discovered using thegravitational microlensingdetection method in a joint effort betweenSwift, Spitzer, and the ground-basedOptical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, the first time two space telescopes have observed the same microlensing event. This method was possible because of the large separation between the two spacecraft: Swift is in low-Earth orbit while Spitzer is more than oneAUdistant in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit.This separation provided significantly different perspectives of the brown dwarf, allowing for constraints to be placed on some of the object's physical characteristics. Reported in March 2016, Spitzer and Hubble were used to discover the most distant-known galaxy,GN-z11. This object was seen as it appeared 13.4 billion years ago. On 1 October 2016, Spitzer began its Observation Cycle 13, a2+1⁄2year extended mission nicknamedBeyond. One of the goals of this extended mission was to help prepare for theJames Webb Space Telescope, also an infrared telescope, by identifying candidates for more detailed observations. Another aspect of theBeyondmission was the engineering challenges of operating Spitzer in its progressing orbital phase. As the spacecraft moved farther from Earth on the same orbital path from the Sun, its antenna had to point at increasingly higher angles to communicate with ground stations; this change in angle imparted more and more solar heating on the vehicle while its solar panels received less sunlight. Spitzer was also put to work studying exoplanets thanks to creatively tweaking its hardware. This included doubling its stability by modifying its heating cycle, finding a new use for the "peak-up" camera, and analyzing the sensor at a sub-pixel level. Although in its "warm" mission, the spacecraft's passive cooling system kept the sensors at 29 K (−244 °C; −407 °F).Spitzer used thetransit photometryandgravitational microlensingtechniques to perform these observations.According to NASA's Sean Carey, "We never even considered using Spitzer for studying exoplanets when it launched. ... It would have seemed ludicrous back then, but now it's an important part of what Spitzer does." Examples of exoplanets discovered using Spitzer includeHD 219134 bin 2015, which was shown to be a rocky planet about 1.5 times as large as Earth in a three-day orbit around its star;and an unnamed planet found using microlensing located about 13,000 light-years (4,000 pc) from Earth. In September–October 2016, Spitzer was used to discover five of a total of seven known planets around the starTRAPPIST-1, all of which are approximately Earth-sized and likely rocky.Three of the discovered planets are located in thehabitable zone, which means they are capable of supportingliquid watergiven sufficient parameters.Using thetransit method, Spitzer helped measure the sizes of the seven planets and estimate the mass and density of the inner six. Further observations will help determine if there is liquid water on any of the planets.

New Horizonsis aninterplanetary space probelaunched as a part ofNASA'sNew Frontiers program.It was launched in 2006, becoming the first spacecraft to perform aflybystudy of thePlutosystem in 2015.  A secondary mission contained a flyby and study of one or more otherKuiper beltobjects (KBOs) in the decade to follow, where it flew past486958 Arrokothin 2019. It was engineered by the Johns Hopkins UniversityApplied Physics Laboratory(APL) and theSouthwest Research Institute(SwRI), with a team led byAlan Stern.New Horizons is thefifth space probeto achieve theescape velocityneeded to leave theSolar System. On January 19, 2006,New Horizonswas launched fromCape Canaveral Space Force Stationby anAtlas Vrocketdirectly into an Earth-and-solarescape trajectorywith a speed of about 16.26 km/s (10.10 mi/s; 58,500 km/h; 36,400 mph). It was the fastest (average speed with respect to Earth) human-made object ever launched from Earth.It is not the fastest speed recorded for a spacecraft, which, as of 2023, is that of theParker Solar Probe. After a brief encounter withasteroid132524 APL,New Horizonsproceeded toJupiter, making its closest approach on February 28, 2007, at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles). The Jupiter flyby provided agravity assistthat increasedNew Horizons'speed; the flyby also enabled a general test ofNew Horizons'scientific capabilities, returning data aboutthe planet's atmosphere,moons, andmagnetosphere. Most of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent inhibernation modeto preserve onboard systems, except for brief annual checkouts.On December 6, 2014,New Horizonswas brought back online for the Pluto encounter, and instrument check-out began.On January 15, 2015, the spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto. On July 14, 2015, at 11:49UTC, it flew 12,500 km (7,800 mi) above the surface of Pluto,which at the time was 34 AU from theSun,making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet.In August 2016,New Horizonswas reported to have traveled at speeds of more than 84,000 km/h (52,000 mph).On October 25, 2016, at 21:48 UTC, the last recorded data from the Pluto flyby was received fromNew Horizons.Having completed its flyby of Pluto,New Horizonsthen maneuvered for a flyby of Kuiper belt object486958 Arrokoth(then nicknamedUltima Thule),which occurred on January 1, 2019,when it was 43.4AU(6.49billionkm; 4.03 billionmi) from the Sun.In August 2018, NASA cited results byAliceonNew Horizonsto confirm the existence of a "hydrogen wall" at theouter edges of the Solar System. This "wall" was first detected in 1992 by the twoVoyager spacecraft. New Horizonsis traveling through the Kuiper belt; it is 62.23AU(9.31billionkm; 5.78 billionmi) from Earth and 62.71AU(9.38billionkm; 5.83 billionmi) from the Sun as of September 2025.NASA has announced it is to extend operations forNew Horizonsuntil the spacecraft exits the Kuiper belt, which is expected to occur in either 2028 or 2029,but the proposed budget for FY2026 cuts funding for New Horizons, and it is set for shut down. In August 1992,JPLscientist Robert Staehle called Pluto discovererClyde Tombaugh, requesting permission to visit his planet. "I told him he was welcome to it," Tombaugh later remembered, "though he's got to go one long, cold trip."The call eventually led to a series of proposed Pluto missions leading up toNew Horizons. Stamatios "Tom" Krimigis, head of theApplied Physics Laboratory's space division, one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition, formed theNew Horizonsteam withAlan Sternin December 2000.  Appointed as the project'sprincipal investigator, Stern was described by Krimigis as "the personification of the Pluto mission".New Horizonswas based largely on Stern's work sincePluto 350and involved most of the team fromPluto Kuiper Express. TheNew Horizonsproposal was one of five that were officially submitted to NASA. It was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three-month concept study in June 2001. The other finalist, POSSE (Pluto and Outer Solar System Explorer), was a separate but similar Pluto mission concept by theUniversity of Colorado Boulder, led by principal investigatorLarry W. Esposito, and supported by the JPL,Lockheed Martinand theUniversity of California. However, the APL, in addition to being supported byPluto Kuiper Expressdevelopers at the Goddard Space Flight Center andStanford Universitywere at an advantage; they had recently developedNEAR Shoemakerfor NASA, which had successfully entered orbit around433 Erosearlier that year, and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare. In November 2001,New Horizonswas officially selected for funding as part of the New Frontiers program.However, the new NASA Administrator appointed by theBush administration,Sean O'Keefe, was not supportive ofNew Horizonsand effectively canceled it by not including it in NASA's budget for 2003. NASA's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate,Ed Weiler, prompted Stern to lobby for the funding ofNew Horizonsin hopes of the mission appearing in thePlanetary Science Decadal Survey, a prioritized "wish list", compiled by theUnited States National Research Council, that reflects the opinions of the scientific community. After an intense campaign to gain support forNew Horizons, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey of 2003–2013 was published in the summer of 2002.New Horizonstopped the list of projects considered the highest priority among the scientific community in the medium-size category; ahead of missions to the Moon, and even Jupiter. Weiler stated that it was a result that "[his] administration was not going to fight".Funding for the mission was finally secured following the publication of the report. Stern's team was finally able to start building the spacecraft and its instruments, with a planned launch in January 2006 and arrival at Pluto in 2015.Alice Bowmanbecame Mission Operations Manager (MOM). New Horizonsis the first mission in NASA's New Frontiers mission category, larger and more expensive than the Discovery missions but smaller than the missions of the Flagship Program. The cost of the mission, including spacecraft and instrument development, launch vehicle, mission operations, data analysis, and education/public outreach, is approximately $700 million over 15 years (2001–2016).The spacecraft was built primarily bySouthwest Research Institute(SwRI) and theJohns HopkinsApplied Physics Laboratory. The mission's principal investigator isAlan Sternof the Southwest Research Institute (formerly NASA Associate Administrator). After separation from the launch vehicle, overall control was taken by Mission Operations Center (MOC) at the Applied Physics Laboratory inHoward County, Maryland. The science instruments are operated at Clyde Tombaugh Science Operations Center (T-SOC) inBoulder, Colorado.Navigation is performed at various contractor facilities, whereas the navigational positional data and related celestial reference frames are provided by theNaval Observatory Flagstaff Stationthrough Headquarters NASA andJPL. KinetXis the lead on theNew Horizonsnavigation team and is responsible for planning trajectory adjustments as the spacecraft speeds towardthe outer Solar System. Coincidentally the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of Pluto's moonCharon. The Naval Observatory itself is not far from theLowell Observatorywhere Pluto was discovered. New Horizonswas originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the Solar System. When the spacecraft was launched, Pluto was still classified as aplanet, later to bereclassifiedas a dwarf planet by theInternational Astronomical Union(IAU). Some members of theNew Horizonsteam, including Alan Stern, disagree with the IAU definition and still describe Pluto as the ninth planet.Pluto's satellitesNixandHydraalso have a connection with the spacecraft: the first letters of their names (N and H) are the initials ofNew Horizons. The moons' discoverers chose these names for this reason, plus Nix and Hydra's relationship to the mythologicalPluto. In addition to the science equipment, there are nine cultural artifacts traveling with the spacecraft.These include a collection of 434,738 names stored on a compact disc,a collection of images of New Horizons project personnel on another CD, a piece ofScaled Composites'sSpaceShipOne,a "Not Yet Explored" USPS stamp,and two copies of theFlag of the United States. About 30 grams (1 oz) of 'Clyde Tombaugh'sashes are aboard the spacecraft, to commemorate his discovery of Pluto in 1930.A Floridastate quartercoin, whose design commemorates human exploration, is included, officially as a trim weight,as is a Maryland state quarter to honor the probe's builders.One of the science packages (a dust counter) is named afterVenetia Burney, who, as a child, suggested the name "Pluto" after its discovery. The goal of the mission is to understand the formation of the Plutonian system, the Kuiper belt, and the transformation of the early Solar System.The spacecraft collected data on the atmospheres, surfaces, interiors, and environments of Pluto and its moons. It will also study other objects in the Kuiper belt."By way of comparison,New Horizonsgathered 5,000 times as much data at Pluto asMarinerdid at theRed Planet." Some of the questions the mission attempts to answer are: What is Pluto's atmosphere made of and how does it behave? What does its surface look like? Are there large geological structures? How dosolar windparticles interact with Pluto's atmosphere? Specifically, the mission's science objectives are to: The spacecraft is comparable in size and general shape to agrand pianoand has been compared to a piano glued to a cocktail bar-sized satellite dish.As a point of departure, the team took inspiration from theUlyssesspacecraft,which also carried aradioisotope thermoelectric generator(RTG) and dish on a box-in-box structure through the outer Solar System. Many subsystems and components have flight heritage from APL'sCONTOURspacecraft, which in turn had heritage from APL'sTIMEDspacecraft. New Horizons'body forms a triangle, almost 0.76 m (2.5 ft) thick. (ThePioneershavehexagonalbodies, whereas theVoyagershavedecagonalbodies,Galileoanoctagonal prismbody,andCassini–Huygensadodecagonal prismbody.) A7075 aluminium alloytube forms the main structural column, between the launch vehicle adapter ring at the "rear", and the 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in) radiodish antennaaffixed to the "front" flat side. Thetitaniumfuel tank is in this tube. The RTG attaches with a 4-sided titanium mount resembling a gray pyramid or stepstool. Titanium provides strength and thermal isolation. The rest of the triangle is primarily sandwich panels of thin aluminum face sheet (less than1⁄64in or 0.40 mm) bonded to aluminum honeycomb core. The structure is larger than strictly necessary, with empty space inside. The structure is designed to act asshielding, reducing electronicserrors caused by radiationfrom the RTG. Also, the mass distribution required for a spinning spacecraft demands a wider triangle. The interior structure is painted black to equalize temperature byradiativeheat transfer. Overall, the spacecraft is thoroughly blanketed to retain heat. Unlike thePioneersandVoyagers, the radio dish is also enclosed in blankets that extend to the body. The heat from the RTG adds warmth to the spacecraft while it is in the outer Solar System. While in the inner Solar System, the spacecraft must prevent overheating, hence electronic activity is limited, power is diverted toshuntswith attached radiators, andlouversare opened to radiate excess heat. While the spacecraft is cruising inactively in the cold outer Solar System, the louvers are closed, and the shunt regulator reroutes power to electricheaters. New Horizonshas both spin-stabilized (cruise) and three-axis stabilized (science) modes controlled entirely withhydrazinemonopropellant. Additional post launchdelta-vof over 290 m/s (1,000 km/h; 650 mph) is provided by a 77 kg (170 lb) internal tank. Helium is used as a pressurant, with anelastomericdiaphragm assisting expulsion. The spacecraft's on-orbit mass including fuel is over 470 kg (1,040 lb) on the Jupiter flyby trajectory, but would have been only 445 kg (981 lb) for the backup direct flight option to Pluto. Significantly, had the backup option been taken, this would have meant less fuel for later Kuiper belt operations. There are 16thrustersonNew Horizons: four 4.4N(1.0lbf) and twelve 0.9 N (0.2 lbf) plumbed into redundant branches. The larger thrusters are used primarily for trajectory corrections, and the small ones (previously used onCassiniand theVoyagerspacecraft) are used primarily forattitude controland spinup/spindown maneuvers. Two star cameras are used to measure the spacecraft attitude. They are mounted on the face of the spacecraft and provide attitude information while in spin-stabilized or 3-axis mode. In between the time of star camera readings, spacecraft orientation is provided by dual redundantminiature inertial measurement units. Each unit contains three solid-stategyroscopesand threeaccelerometers. Two AdcoleSun sensorsprovide attitude determination. One detects the angle to the Sun, whereas the other measures spin rate and clocking. A cylindricalradioisotope thermoelectric generator(RTG) protrudes in the plane of the triangle from one vertex of the triangle. The RTG provided245.7Wof power at launch, and was predicted to drop approximately3.5Wevery year, decaying to202 Wby the time of its encounter with thePlutonian systemin 2015 and will decay too far to power the transmitters in the 2030s.There are no onboard batteries since RTG output is predictable, and load transients are handled by a capacitor bank and fast circuit breakers. As of January 2019, the power output of the RTG is about190W. The RTG, model "GPHS-RTG", was originally a spare from theCassinimission. The RTG contains 9.75 kg (21.5 lb) ofplutonium-238oxide pellets.Each pellet is clad iniridium, then encased in a graphite shell. It was developed by the U.S.Department of Energyat the Materials and Fuels Complex, a part of theIdaho National Laboratory.The original RTG design called for  10.9 kg (24 lb) of plutonium, but a unit less powerful than the original design goal was produced because of delays at the United States Department of Energy, including security activities, that delayed plutonium production.The mission parameters and observation sequence had to be modified for the reduced wattage; still, not all instruments can operate simultaneously. The Department of Energy transferred the space battery program from Ohio to Argonne in 2002 because of security concerns. The amount of radioactive plutonium in the RTG is about one-third the amount on board the Cassini–Huygens probe when it launched in 1997. The Cassini launch had been protested by multiple organizations, due to the risk of such a large amount of plutonium being released into the atmosphere in case of an accident. The United States Department of Energy estimated the chances of a launch accident that would release radiation into the atmosphere at 1 in 350, and monitored the launchbecause of the inclusion of an RTG on board. It was estimated that a worst-case scenario of total dispersal of on-board plutonium would spread the equivalent radiation of 80% the average annual dosage in North America from background radiation over an area with a radius of 105 km (65 mi). The spacecraft carries twocomputersystems: the Command and Data Handling system and the Guidance and Control processor. Each of the two systems is duplicated forredundancy, for a total of four computers. The processor used for its flight computers is theMongoose-V, a 12MHzradiation-hardened version of theMIPS R3000CPU. Multiple redundant clocks and timing routines are implemented in hardware and software to help prevent faults and downtime. To conserve heat and mass, spacecraft and instrument electronics are housed together in IEMs (integrated electronics modules). There are two redundant IEMs. Including other functions such as instrument and radio electronics, each IEM contains 9 boards.The software of the probe runs onNucleus RTOSoperating system. There have been two "safing" events, that sent the spacecraft intosafe mode: Communication with the spacecraft is viaX band. The craft had a communication rate of38 kbit/sat Jupiter; at Pluto's distance, a rate of approximately1kbit/sper transmitter was expected. Besides the low data rate, Pluto's distance also causes alatencyof about 4.5 hours (one-way). The 70 m (230 ft)NASA Deep Space Network(DSN) dishes are used to relay commands once the spacecraft is beyond Jupiter.  The spacecraft usesdual modular redundancytransmitters and receivers, and either right- or left-handcircular polarization. The downlink signal is amplified by dual redundant 12-watttraveling-wave tubeamplifiers (TWTAs) mounted on the body under the dish. The receivers are low-power designs. The system can be controlled to power both TWTAs at the same time, and transmit a dual-polarized downlink signal to the DSN that nearly doubles the downlink rate. DSN tests early in the mission with this dual polarization combining technique were successful, and the capability was declared to be operational (when the spacecraft power budget permits both TWTAs to be powered). In addition to thehigh-gain antenna, there are two backup low-gain antennas and a medium-gain dish. The high-gain dish has aCassegrain reflectorlayout, composite construction, of 2.1-meter (7 ft) diameter providing over42dBiof gain and a half-power beam width of about a degree. The prime-focus medium-gain antenna, with a 0.3-meter (1 ft) aperture and 10° half-power beam width, is mounted to the forward-facing side of the high-gain antenna's secondary reflector. The forward low-gain antenna is stacked atop the feed of the medium-gain antenna. The aft low-gain antenna is mounted within the launch adapter at the rear of the spacecraft. This antenna was used only for early mission phases near Earth, just after launch and for emergencies if the spacecraft had lost attitude control. New Horizonsrecorded scientific instrument data to its solid-state memory buffer at each encounter, then transmitted the data to Earth. Data storage is done on two low-powersolid-state recorders(one primary, one backup) holding up to8gigabytes each. Because of the extreme distance from Pluto and the Kuiper belt, only one buffer load at those encounters can be saved. This is becauseNew Horizonswould require approximately 16 months after leaving the vicinity of Pluto to transmit the buffer load back to Earth.At Pluto's distance, radio signals from the space probe back to Earth took four hours and 25 minutes to traverse 4.7 billion km of space. Part of the reason for the delay between the gathering of and transmission of data is that all of theNew Horizonsinstrumentation is body-mounted. In order for the cameras to record data, the entire probe must turn, and the one-degree-wide beam of the high-gain antenna was not pointing toward Earth.  Previous spacecraft, such as theVoyagerprogram probes, had a rotatable instrumentation platform (a "scan platform") that could take measurements from virtually any angle without losing radio contact with Earth.New Horizonswas mechanically simplified to save weight, shorten the schedule, and improve reliability during its 15-year designed lifetime. New Horizonscarries seven instruments: three optical instruments, two plasma instruments, a dust sensor and a radio science receiver/radiometer. The instruments are to be used to investigate the global geology, surface composition, surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature and escape rate of Pluto and its moons. The rated power is21 watts, though not all instruments operate simultaneously.In addition,New Horizonshas an Ultrastable Oscillator subsystem, which may be used to study and test thePioneer anomalytowards the end of the spacecraft's life. The Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) is a long-focal-length imager designed for high resolution and responsivity at visible wavelengths. The instrument is equipped with a 1024×1024 pixel by 12-bits-per-pixel monochromaticCCDimager giving a resolution of 5μrad(~1arcsec).The CCD is chilled far below freezing by a passive radiator on the antisolar face of the spacecraft. This temperature differential requires insulation and isolation from the rest of the structure. The 208.3 mm (8.20 in) apertureRitchey–Chretienmirrors and metering structure are made ofsilicon carbideto boost stiffness, reduce weight and prevent warping at low temperatures. The optical elements sit in a composite light shield and mount with titanium and fiberglass for thermal isolation. Overall mass is 8.6 kg (19 lb), with the optical tube assembly (OTA) weighing about 5.6 kg (12 lb),for one of the largest silicon-carbide telescopes flown at the time (now surpassed byHerschel). For viewing on public web sites the 12-bit per pixel LORRI images are converted to 8-bit per pixelJPEGimages.These public images do not contain the fulldynamic rangeof brightness information available from the raw LORRI images files. Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) is a toroidalelectrostatic analyzerand retarding potential analyzer (RPA), that makes up one of the two instruments comprisingNew Horizons'Plasmaand high-energy particle spectrometer suite (PAM), the other being PEPSSI. SWAP measures particles of up to 6.5 keV and, because of the tenuous solar wind at Pluto's distance, the instrument is designed with the largestapertureof any such instrument ever flown. Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI) is atime of flightionandelectronsensor that makes up one of the two instruments comprisingNew Horizons'plasma and high-energy particle spectrometer suite (PAM), the other being SWAP. Unlike SWAP, which measures particles of up to 6.5 keV, PEPSSI goes up to 1 MeV.The PEPSSI sensor has been designed to measure the mass, energy and distribution of charged particles around Pluto, and is also able to differentiate betweenprotons,electrons, and otherheavy ions. Aliceis anultravioletimagingspectrometerthat is one of two photographic instruments comprisingNew Horizons'Pluto Exploration Remote Sensing Investigation (PERSI); the other being theRalphtelescope. It resolves 1,024 wavelength bands in the far and extreme ultraviolet (from 50–180nm), over 32 view fields. Its goal is to determine the composition of Pluto's atmosphere. This Alice instrument is derived from another Alice aboardESA'sRosettaspacecraft.The instrument has a mass of 4.4 kg and draws 4.4 watts of power. Its primary role is to determine the relative concentrations of various elements and isotopes in Pluto's atmosphere. In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results byAliceon theNew Horizonsspacecraft, a "hydrogen wall" at the outer edges of theSolar Systemthat was first detected in 1992 by the twoVoyager spacecraft. The Ralph telescope,  75 mmin aperture, is one of two photographic instruments that make upNew Horizons'Pluto Exploration Remote Sensing Investigation (PERSI), with the other being the Alice instrument. Ralph has two separate channels: MVIC (Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera), a visible-lightCCDimager with broadband and color channels; and LEISA (Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array), a near-infraredimaging spectrometer. LEISA is derived from a similar instrument on theEarth Observing-1spacecraft. Ralph was named after Alice's husband onThe Honeymooners, and was designed after Alice. On June 23, 2017, NASA announced that it has renamed the LEISA instrument to the "Lisa Hardaway Infrared Mapping Spectrometer" in honor ofLisa Hardaway, the Ralph program manager atBall Aerospace, who died in January 2017 at age 50. TheVenetia Burney Student Dust Counter(VBSDC), built by students at the University of Colorado Boulder, is operating periodically to makedustmeasurements.It consists of a detector panel, about 460 mm × 300 mm (18 in × 12 in), mounted on the anti-solar face of the spacecraft (the ram direction), and an electronics box within the spacecraft. The detector contains fourteenpolyvinylidene difluoride(PVDF) panels, twelve science and two reference, which generate voltage when impacted. Effective collecting area is 0.125 m2(1.35 sq ft). No dust counter has operated past the orbit ofUranus; models of dust in the outer Solar System, especially the Kuiper belt, are speculative. The VBSDC is always turned on measuring the masses of the interplanetary and interstellar dust particles (in the range of nano- and picograms) as they collide with the PVDF panels mounted on theNew Horizonsspacecraft. The measured data is expected to greatly contribute to the understanding of the dust spectra of the Solar System. The dust spectra can then be compared with those from observations of other stars, giving new clues as to where Earth-like planets can be found in the universe. The dust counter is named forVenetia Burney, who first suggested the name "Pluto" at the age of 11. A thirteen-minute short film about the VBSDC garnered an Emmy Award for student achievement in 2006. The Radio Science Experiment (REX) used an ultrastablecrystal oscillator(essentially a calibrated crystal in a miniatureoven) and some additional electronics to conduct radio science investigations using the communications channels. These are small enough to fit on a single card. Because there are two redundant communications subsystems, there are two, identical REX circuit boards. On September 24, 2005, the spacecraft arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on board aC-17 Globemaster IIIfor launch preparations.The launch ofNew Horizonswas originally scheduled for January 11, 2006, but was initially delayed until January 17, 2006, to allow forborescopeinspections of theAtlas V'skerosenetank. Further delays related to low cloud ceiling conditionsdownrange, and high winds and technical difficulties—unrelated to the rocket itself—prevented launch for a further two days. The probe finally lifted off fromPad 41atCape Canaveral Air Force Station,Florida, directly south ofSpace ShuttleLaunch Complex 39, at 19:00 UTC on January 19, 2006.TheCentaursecond stage ignited at 19:04:43 UTC and burned for 5 minutes 25 seconds. It reignited at 19:32 UTC and burned for 9 minutes 47 seconds. TheATKStar 48B third stage ignited at 19:42:37 UTC and burned for 1 minute 28 seconds.Combined, these burns successfully sent the probe on a solar-escape trajectory at 16.26 kilometers per second (58,536 km/h; 36,373 mph).New Horizonstook only nine hours to pass the Moon's orbit.Although there were backup launch opportunities in February 2006 and February 2007, only the first twenty-three days of the 2006 window permitted the Jupiter flyby. Any launch outside that period would have forced the spacecraft to fly a slower trajectory directly to Pluto, delaying its encounter by five to six years. The probe was launched by aLockheed MartinAtlas V 551 rocket, with a third stage added to increase the heliocentric (escape) speed. This was the first launch of the Atlas V 551 configuration, which uses fivesolid rocket boosters, and the first Atlas V with a third stage. Previous flights had used zero, two, or three solid boosters, but never five. The vehicle, AV-010, weighed 573,160 kilograms (1,263,600 lb) at lift-off,and had earlier been slightly damaged whenHurricane Wilmaswept across Florida on October 24, 2005. One of the solid rocket boosters was hit by a door. The booster was replaced with an identical unit, rather than inspecting and requalifying the original. The launch was dedicated to the memory of launch conductorDaniel Sarokon, who was described by space program officials as one of the most influential people in the history of space travel. On January 28 and 30, 2006, mission controllers guided the probe through its firsttrajectory-correction maneuver (TCM), which was divided into two parts (TCM-1A and TCM-1B). The total velocity change of these two corrections was about 18 meters per second (65 km/h; 40 mph). TCM-1 was accurate enough to permit the cancellation of TCM-2, the second of three originally scheduled corrections.On March 9, 2006, controllers performed TCM-3, the last of three scheduled course corrections. The engines burned for 76 seconds, adjusting the spacecraft's velocity by about 1.16 m/s (4.2 km/h; 2.6 mph).Further trajectory maneuvers were not needed until September 25, 2007 (seven months after the Jupiter flyby), when the engines were fired for 15 minutes and 37 seconds, changing the spacecraft's velocity by 2.37 m/s (8.5 km/h; 5.3 mph),followed by another TCM, almost three years later on June 30, 2010, that lasted 35.6 seconds, whenNew Horizonshad already reached the halfway point (in time traveled) to Pluto. During the week of February 20, 2006, controllers conducted initial in-flight tests of three onboard science instruments, the Alice ultraviolet imaging spectrometer, the PEPSSI plasma-sensor, and the LORRI long-range visible-spectrum camera. No scientific measurements or images were taken, but instrument electronics, and in the case of Alice, some electromechanical systems were shown to be functioning correctly. On April 7, 2006, the spacecraft passed the orbit of Mars, moving at roughly 21 km/s (76,000 km/h; 47,000 mph) away from the Sun at a solar distance of 243 million kilometers. Because of the need to conserve fuel for possible encounters with Kuiper belt objects subsequent to the Pluto flyby, intentional encounters with objects in theasteroid beltwere not planned. After launch, theNew Horizonsteam scanned the spacecraft's trajectory to determine if any asteroids would, by chance, be close enough for observation. In May 2006 it was discovered thatNew Horizonswould pass close to the tiny asteroid132524 APLon June 13, 2006. Closest approach occurred at 4:05 UTC at a distance of 101,867 km (63,297 mi) (around one quarter of theaverage Earth-Moon distance). The asteroid was imaged by Ralph (use of LORRI was not possible because of proximity to the Sun), which gave the team a chance to test Ralph'scapabilities, and make observations of the asteroid's composition as well as light and phase curves. The asteroid was estimated to be 2.5 km (1.6 mi) in diameter.The spacecraft successfully tracked the rapidly moving asteroid over June 10–12, 2006. The first images of Pluto fromNew Horizonswere acquired September 21–24, 2006, during a test of LORRI. They were released on November 28, 2006.The images, taken from a distance of approximately 4.2 billion km (2.6 billion mi; 28 AU), confirmed the spacecraft's ability to track distant targets, critical for maneuvering toward Pluto and other Kuiper belt objects. New Horizonsused LORRI to take its first photographs of Jupiter on September 4, 2006, from a distance of 291 million kilometers (181 million miles).More detailed exploration of the system began in January 2007 with an infrared image of the moonCallisto, as well as several black-and-white images of Jupiter itself.New Horizonsreceived a gravity assist from Jupiter, with its closest approach at 05:43:40 UTC on February 28, 2007, when it was 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Jupiter. The flyby increasedNew Horizons'speed by 4 km/s (14,000 km/h; 9,000 mph), accelerating the probe to a velocity of 23 km/s (83,000 km/h; 51,000 mph) relative to the Sun and shortening its voyage to Pluto by three years. The flyby was the center of a four-month intensive observation campaign lasting from January to June. Being an ever-changing scientific target, Jupiter has been observed intermittently since the end of theGalileomission in September 2003. Knowledge about Jupiter benefited from the fact thatNew Horizons'instruments were built using the latest technology, especially in the area of cameras, representing a significant improvement overGalileo'scameras, which were modified versions ofVoyagercameras, which, in turn, were modifiedMarinercameras. The Jupiter encounter also served as a shakedown and dress rehearsal for the Pluto encounter. Because Jupiter is much closer to Earth than Pluto, the communications link can transmit multiple loadings of the memory buffer; thus the mission returned more data from the Jovian system than it was expected to transmit from Pluto. One of the main goals during the Jupiter encounter was observing itsatmospheric conditionsand analyzing the structure and composition of its clouds. Heat-induced lightning strikes in the polar regions and "waves" that indicate violent storm activity were observed and measured. TheLittle Red Spot, spanning up to 70% of Earth's diameter, was imaged from up close for the first time.Recording from different angles and illumination conditions,New Horizonstook detailed images of Jupiter's faintring system, discovering debris left over from recent collisions within the rings or from other unexplained phenomena. The search for undiscovered moons within the rings showed no results. Travelling through Jupiter'smagnetosphere,New Horizonscollected valuable particle readings."Bubbles" of plasma that are thought to be formed from material ejected by the moon Io were noticed in themagnetotail. The four largest moons of Jupiter were in poor positions for observation; the necessary path of the gravity-assist maneuver meant thatNew Horizonspassed millions of kilometers from any of theGalilean moons. Still, its instruments were intended for small, dim targets, so they were scientifically useful on large, distant moons. Emphasis was put on Jupiter's innermost Galilean moon,Io, whose active volcanoes shoot out tons of material into Jupiter's magnetosphere, and further. Out of eleven observed eruptions, three were seen for the first time. That ofTvashtarreached an altitude of up to 330 km (210 mi). The event gave scientists an unprecedented look into the structure and motion of the rising plume and its subsequent fall back to the surface. Infrared signatures of a further 36 volcanoes were noticed.Callisto's surface was analyzed with LEISA, revealing how lighting and viewing conditions affect infrared spectrum readings of its surface water ice.Minor moons such asAmaltheahad their orbit solutions refined. The cameras determined their positions, acting as "reverse optical navigation". After passing Jupiter,New Horizonsspent most of its journey towards Pluto in hibernation mode. Redundant components as well as guidance and control systems were shut down to extend their life cycle, decrease operation costs and free theDeep Space Networkfor other missions.During hibernation mode, the onboard computer monitored the probe's systems and transmitted a signal back to Earth; a "green" code if everything was functioning as expected or a "red" code if mission control's assistance was needed.The probe was activated for about two months a year so that the instruments could be calibrated and the systems checked. The first hibernation mode cycle started on June 28, 2007,the second cycle began on December 16, 2008,the third cycle on August 27, 2009,and the fourth cycle on August 29, 2014, after a 10-week test. New Horizonscrossed the orbit ofSaturnon June 8, 2008,andUranuson March 18, 2011.After astronomers announced the discovery of two new moons in the Pluto system,KerberosandStyx, mission planners started contemplating the possibility of the probe running into unseen debris and dust left over from ancient collisions between the moons. A study based on 18 months of computer simulations, Earth-based telescope observations and occultations of the Pluto system revealed that the possibility of a catastrophic collision with debris or dust was less than 0.3% on the probe's scheduled course.If the hazard increased,New Horizonscould have used one of two possible contingency plans, the so-called SHBOTs (Safe Haven by Other Trajectories). Either the probe could have continued on its present trajectory with the antenna facing the incoming particles so the more vital systems would be protected, or it could have positioned its antenna to make a course correction that would take it just 3,000 km (1,900 mi) from the surface of Pluto where it was expected that theatmospheric dragwould have cleaned the surrounding space of possible debris. While in hibernation mode in July 2012,New Horizonsstarted gathering scientific data with SWAP, PEPSSI and VBSDC. Although it was originally planned to activate just the VBSDC, other instruments were powered on in order to collect valuable heliospheric data. Before activating the other two instruments, ground tests were conducted to make sure that the expanded data gathering in this phase of the mission would not limit available energy, memory and fuel in the future and that all systems were functioning during the flyby.The first set of data was transmitted in January 2013 during a three-week activation from hibernation. The command and data handling software was updated to address the problem of computer resets. Other possible targets wereNeptune trojans. The probe's trajectory to Pluto passed near Neptune's trailingLagrange point("L5"), which may host hundreds of bodies in 1:1resonance. In late 2013,New Horizonspassed within 1.2 AU (180 million km; 110 million mi) of the high-inclination L5 Neptune trojan2011 HM102,which was discovered shortly before by theNew Horizons KBO Searchtask, asurveyto find additionaldistant objectsforNew Horizonsto fly by after its 2015 encounter with Pluto. At that range,2011 HM102would have been bright enough to be detectable byNew Horizons'LORRI instrument; however, theNew Horizonsteam eventually decided that they would not target2011 HM102for observations because the preparations for the Pluto approach took precedence.On August 25, 2014,New Horizonscrossed the orbit ofNeptune, exactly 25 years after the planet was visited by theVoyager 2probe.This was the last major planet orbit crossing before the Pluto flyby. At the time, the spacecraft was 3.99 billion km (2.48 billion mi; 26.7 AU) away from Neptune and 4.51 billion km (2.80 billion mi; 30.1 AU) from the Sun. Images from July 1 to 3, 2013, by LORRI were the first by the probe to resolve Pluto and Charon as separate objects.On July 14, 2014, mission controllers performed a sixth trajectory-correction maneuver (TCM) since its launch to enable the craft to reach Pluto.Between July 19–24, 2014,New Horizons'LORRI snapped 12 images of Charon revolving around Pluto, covering almost one full rotation at distances ranging from about 429 to 422 million km (267 to 262 million mi).In August 2014, astronomers made high-precision measurements of Pluto's location and orbit around the Sun using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), an array of radio telescopes located in Chile, to help NASA'sNew Horizonsspacecraft accurately home in on Pluto.On December 6, 2014, mission controllers sent a signal for the craft to "wake up" from its final Pluto-approach hibernation and begin regular operations. The craft's response that it was "awake" reached Earth on December 7, 2014, at 02:30 UTC. Distant-encounter operations at Pluto began on January 4, 2015.On this date, images of the targets with the onboard LORRI imager plus the Ralph telescope were only a fewpixelsin width. Investigators began taking Pluto images and background starfield images to assist mission navigators in the design of course-correcting engine maneuvers that would precisely modify the trajectory ofNew Horizonsto aim the approach. On February 12, 2015, NASA released new images of Pluto (taken from January 25 to 31) from the approaching probe.New Horizonswas more than 203 million km (126 million mi) away from Pluto when it began taking the photos, which showed Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. The exposure time was too short to see Pluto's smaller, much fainter moons. Investigators compiled a series of images of the moons Nix and Hydra taken from January 27 through February 8, 2015, beginning at a range of 201 million km (125 million mi).Pluto and Charon appear as a single overexposed object at the center. The right side image has been processed to remove the background starfield. The other two, even smaller moons—Kerberos and Styx—were seen on photos taken on April 25.Starting on May 11, a hazard search was performed, looking for unknown objects that could be a danger to the spacecraft, such as rings or hitherto undiscovered moons, which could then possibly be avoided by a course change.No rings or additional moons were found. Also in regard to the approach phase during January 2015, on August 21, 2012, the team announced that they would spend mission time attempting long-range observations of the Kuiper belt object temporarily designatedVNH0004(now designated2011 KW48), when the object was at a distance of 75 million km (0.50 AU; 47 million mi) fromNew Horizons.The object would be too distant to resolve surface features or take spectroscopy, but it would be able to make observations that cannot be made from Earth, namely aphase curveand a search for small moons. A second object was planned to be observed in June 2015, and a third in September after the flyby; the team hoped to observe a dozen such objects through 2018.On April 15, 2015, Pluto was imaged showing a possible polar cap. On July 4, 2015,New Horizonsexperienced a software anomaly and went into safe mode, preventing the spacecraft from performing scientific observations until engineers could resolve the problem.On July 5, NASA announced that the problem was determined to be a timing flaw in a command sequence used to prepare the spacecraft for its flyby, and the spacecraft would resume scheduled science operations on July 7. The science observations lost because of the anomaly were judged to have no impact on the mission's main objectives and minimal impact on other objectives. The timing flaw consisted of performing two tasks simultaneously—compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, and making a second copy of the approach command sequence—that together overloaded the spacecraft's primary computer. After the overload was detected, the spacecraft performed as designed: it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer, entered safe mode, and sent a distress call back to Earth. The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4 and alerted engineers that they needed to contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue. The resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach, and was not expected to happen again because no similar tasks were planned for the remainder of the encounter. The closest approach of theNew Horizonsspacecraft to Pluto occurred at 11:49 UTC on July 14, 2015, at a range of 12,472 km (7,750 mi) from the surfaceand 13,658 km (8,487 mi) from the center of Pluto.Telemetrydata confirming a successful flyby and a healthy spacecraft was received on Earth from the vicinity of the Pluto system on July 15, 2015, 00:52:37 UTC,after 22 hours of plannedradio silencedue to the spacecraft being pointed towards thePluto system. Mission managers estimated a one in 10,000 chance that debris could have destroyed the probe or its communication-systems during the flyby, preventing it from sending data to Earth.The first details of the encounter were received the next day, but the download of the complete data set through the 2kbpsdata downlink took just over 15 months. The mission's science objectives were grouped in three distinct priorities. The "primary objectives" were required. The "secondary objectives" were expected to be met but were not demanded. The "tertiary objectives" were desired. These objectives could have been skipped in favor of the above objectives. An objective to measure any magnetic field of Pluto was dropped, due to mass and the expense associated with including amagnetometeron the spacecraft. Instead,SWAP and PEPSSIcould indirectly detect magnetic fields around Pluto. "The New Horizons flyby of the Pluto system was fully successful, meeting and in many cases exceeding, the Pluto objectives set out for it by NASA and the National Academy of Sciences." On July 14, 2015, at 11:50 UTC,New Horizonsmade its closest approach to Pluto, passing within 12,500 km (7,800 mi) at a speed of 13.78 km/s (49,600 km/h; 30,800 mph), while also coming as close as 28,800 km (17,900 mi) to Charon. Starting 3.2 days prior, the spacecraft mapped Pluto and Charon with 40 km (25 mi) resolution, enabling coverage of all sides. Close-range imaging was conducted twice daily to monitor for surface changes, such as snowfall orcryovolcanism. During the flyby, LORRI captured images with up to 50 m (160 ft) resolution, MVIC created four-color global maps at 1.6 km (1 mi) resolution, and LEISA obtained near-infrared hyperspectral maps at resolutions ranging from 7 km/px (4.3 mi/px) globally to 0.6 km/px (0.37 mi/px) for selected areas. Meanwhile, Alice characterized the atmosphere, both by emissions of atmospheric molecules (airglow), and by dimming of background stars as they pass behind Pluto (occultation). During and after closest approach, SWAP and PEPSSI sampled the high atmosphere and its effects on the solar wind. VBSDC searched for dust, inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings. REX performed active and passive radio science. The communications dish on Earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of theradio occultationsignal as the probe flew by behind Pluto. The results resolved Pluto's diameter (by their timing) and atmospheric density and composition (by their weakening and strengthening pattern). (Alice can perform similar occultations, using sunlight instead of radio beacons.) Previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere, to Earth ("downlink"). Pluto's mass and mass distribution were evaluated by the gravitational tug on the spacecraft. As the spacecraft speeds up and slows down, the radio signal exhibited aDoppler shift. The Doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics. Reflected sunlight from Charon allowed some imaging observations of the nightside. Backlighting by the Sun gave an opportunity to highlight any rings or atmospheric hazes. REX performed radiometry of the nightside. New Horizons'best spatial resolution of the small satellites is 330 m per pixel (1,080 ft/px) at Nix, 780 m/px (2,560 ft/px) at Hydra, and approximately 1.8 km/px (1.1 mi/px) at Kerberos and Styx. Estimates for the dimensions of these bodies are: Nix at 49.8 × 33.2 × 31.1 km (30.9 × 20.6 × 19.3 mi); Hydra at 50.9 × 36.1 × 30.9 km (31.6 × 22.4 × 19.2 mi); Kerberos at 19 × 10 × 9 km (11.8 × 6.2 × 5.6 mi); and Styx at 16 × 9 × 8 km (9.9 × 5.6 × 5.0 mi). Initial predictions envisioned Kerberos as a relatively large and massive object whose dark surface led to it having a faint reflection. This proved to be wrong as images obtained byNew Horizonson July 14 and sent back to Earth in October 2015 revealed that Kerberos was smaller in size, 19 km (12 mi) across with a highly reflective surface suggesting the presence of relatively clean water ice similarly to the rest of Pluto's smaller moons. Soon after the Pluto flyby, in July 2015,New Horizonsreported that the spacecraft was healthy, its flight path was within the margins, and science data of the Pluto–Charon system had been recorded.The spacecraft's immediate task was to begin returning the 6.25 gigabytes of information collected.Thefree-space path lossat its distance of 4.5light-hours(3 billion km or 20 AU or 1.9 billion mi) is approximately 303dBat 7 GHz. Using thehigh gain antennaand transmitting at full power, the signal fromEIRPis +83 dBm, and at this distance, the signal reaching Earth is −220 dBm. The received signal level (RSL) using one, un-arrayedDeep Space Networkantenna with 72 dBi of forward gain equals −148 dBm.Because of the extremely low RSL, it could only transmit data at 1 to 2kilobits per second. By March 30, 2016, about nine months after the flyby,New Horizonsreached the halfway point of transmitting this data.The transfer was completed on October 25, 2016, at 21:48 UTC, when the last piece of data—part of a Pluto–Charon observation sequence by the Ralph/LEISA imager—was received by the Johns Hopkins UniversityApplied Physics Laboratory. As of November 2018, at a distance of 43 AU (6.43 billion km; 4.00 billion mi) from the Sun and 0.4 AU (60 million km; 37 million mi) from 486958 Arrokoth,New Horizonswasheading in the directionof the constellationSagittariusat 14.10km/s(8.76mi/s; 2.97AU/a) relative to the Sun.The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft wasmagnitude−18.5. On April 17, 2021,New Horizonsreached a distance of 50 AU from the Sun, while remaining fully operational. TheNew Horizonsteam requested, and received, a mission extension through 2021 to explore additional Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). Funding was secured on July 1, 2016.During this Kuiper Belt Extended Mission (KEM) the spacecraft performed a close fly-by of486958 Arrokothand will conduct more distant observations of an additional two dozen objects,and possibly make a fly-by of another KBO.[citation needed] Mission planners searched for one or more additional Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) of the order of 50–100 km (30–60 mi) in diameter as targets for flybys similar to the spacecraft's Plutonian encounter. However, despite the large population of KBOs, many factors limited the number of possible targets. Because the flight path was determined by the Pluto flyby, and the probe only had 33 kg (73 lb) ofhydrazinepropellantremaining, the object to be visited needed to be within a cone of less than a degree's width extending from Pluto. The target also needed to be within 55 AU, because beyond 55 AU, the communications link becomes too weak, and the RTG power output decays significantly enough to hinder observations.Desirable KBOs are well over 50 km (30 mi) in diameter, neutral in color (to contrast with the reddish Pluto), and, if possible, have a moon that imparts a wobble.[citation needed] In 2011, mission scientists started theNew Horizons KBO Search, a dedicatedsurveyfor suitable KBOs using ground telescopes. Large ground telescopes with wide-field cameras, notably the twin 6.5-meterMagellan Telescopesin Chile, the 8.2-meterSubaru Observatoryin Hawaii and theCanada–France–Hawaii Telescopewere used to search for potential targets. By participating in acitizen-scienceproject calledIce Huntersthe public helped to scan telescopic images for possible suitable mission candidates.The ground-based search resulted in the discovery of about 143 KBOs of potential interest,but none of these were close enough to the flight path ofNew Horizons.Only theHubble Space Telescopewas deemed likely to find a suitable target in time for a successful KBO mission.On June 16, 2014, time on Hubble was granted for a search.Hubble has a much greater ability to find suitable KBOs than ground telescopes. The probability that a target forNew Horizonswould be found was estimated beforehand at about 95%. On October 15, 2014, it was revealed that Hubble's search had uncovered three potential targets,temporarily designated PT1 ("potential target 1"), PT2 and PT3 by theNew Horizonsteam. PT1 was eventually chosen as the target and would be named486958 Arrokoth. All objects had estimated diameters in the 30–55 km (19–34 mi) range and were too small to be seen by ground telescopes. The targets were at distances from the Sun ranging from 43 to 44 AU, which would put the encounters in the 2018–2019 period.The initial estimated probabilities that these objects were reachable withinNew Horizons'fuel budget were 100%, 7%, and 97%, respectively.All were members of the "cold" (low-inclination, low-eccentricity)classical Kuiper beltobjects, and thus were very different from Pluto. PT1(given the temporary designation "1110113Y" on the HST web site), the most favorably situated object, had a magnitude of 26.8, is 30–45 km (19–28 mi) in diameter, and was encountered in January 2019.A course change to reach it required about 35% ofNew Horizons'availabletrajectory-adjustment fuel supply.  A mission to PT3 was in some ways preferable, in that it is brighter and therefore probably larger than PT1, but the greater fuel requirements to reach it would have left less for maneuvering and unforeseen events. Once sufficient orbital information was provided, theMinor Planet Centergaveprovisional designationsto the three target KBOs:2014 MU69(PT1' later 486958 Arrokoth),2014 OS393(PT2), and2014 PN70(PT3). By the fall of 2014, a possible fourth target,2014 MT69, had been eliminated by follow-up observations. PT2 was out of the running before the Pluto flyby. On August 28, 2015, 486958Arrokoth(then known as(486958) 2014 MU69and nicknamedUltima Thule) (PT1) was chosen as the flyby target. The necessary course adjustment was performed with four engine firings between October 22 and November 4, 2015.The flyby occurred on January 1, 2019, at 00:33 UTC. Aside from its flyby of 486958 Arrokoth, the extended mission forNew Horizonscalls for the spacecraft to conduct observations of, and look for ring systems around, between 25 and 35 different KBOs.In addition, it will continue to study the gas, dust and plasma composition of the Kuiper belt before the mission extension ends in 2021.[needs update] On November 2, 2015,New Horizonsimaged KBO15810 Arawnwith the LORRI instrument from 280 million km away (170 million mi; 1.9 AU).This KBO was again imaged by the LORRI instrument on April 7–8, 2016, from a distance of 111 million km (69 million mi; 0.74 AU). The new images allowed the science team to further refine the location of 15810 Arawn to within 1,000 km (620 mi) and to determine its rotational period of 5.47 hours. In July 2016, the LORRI camera captured some distant images ofQuaoarfrom 2.1 billion km away (1.3 billion mi; 14 AU); the oblique view will complement Earth-based observations to study the object's light-scattering properties. On December 5, 2017, whenNew Horizonswas 40.9 AU from Earth, a calibration image of theWishing Well clustermarked the most distant image ever taken by a spacecraft (breaking the 27-year record set byVoyager 1's famousPale Blue Dot). Two hours later,New Horizonssurpassed its own record, imaging the Kuiper belt objects2012 HZ84and2012 HE85from a distance of 0.50 and 0.34 AU, respectively. These were the closest images taken of a Kuiper belt object besides Pluto and Arrokoth as of February 2018[update]. The dwarf planetHaumeawas observed from afar by theNew Horizonsspacecraft in October 2007, January 2017, and May 2020, from distances of 49 AU, 59 AU, and 63 AU, respectively.New Horizonshas observed the dwarf planets Eris (2020), Haumea (2007, 2017, 2020), Makemake (2007, 2017), and Quaoar (2016, 2017, 2019), as well as the large KBOsIxion(2016),Máni(2016, 2017, 2019), and2014 OE394(2017, 2018). It also observed Neptune's largest moonTriton(which shares similarities with Pluto and Eris) in 2019. By December 2023,New Horizonshad discovered a total of about 100 KBOs, and flown close enough to about 20 of them to capture characteristics such as shape, rotational period, possible moons, and surface composition. In addition, since 2021, Canadian researchers had been able to usemachine learningsoftware to speed up identification processes of potential KBO targets for a third flyby, cutting weeks-long efforts to hours-long. Science objectives of the flyby included characterizing the geology and morphology ofArrokothand mapping the surface composition (by searching for ammonia, carbon monoxide, methane, and water ice). Searches will be conducted for orbiting moonlets, a coma, rings and the surrounding environment.Additional objectives include: Arrokoth is the first object to be targeted for a flyby that was discovered after the spacecraft was launched.New Horizonswas planned to come within 3,500 km (2,200 mi) of Arrokoth, three times closer than the spacecraft's earlier encounter with Pluto. Images with a resolution of up to 30 m (98 ft) per pixel were expected. The new mission began on October 22, 2015, whenNew Horizonscarried out the first in a series of four initial targeting maneuvers designed to send it towards Arrokoth. The maneuver, which started at approximately 19:50 UTC and used two of the spacecraft's small hydrazine-fueled thrusters, lasted approximately 16 minutes and changed the spacecraft's trajectory by about 10 meters per second (33 ft/s). The remaining three targeting maneuvers took place on October 25, October 28, and November 4, 2015. The craft was brought out of its hibernation at approximately 00:33UTCSCETon June 5, 2018 (06:12 UTCERT, Earth-Received Time),[a]in order to prepare for the approach phase.After verifying its health status, the spacecraft transitioned from aspin-stabilizedmode to a three-axis-stabilized mode on August 13, 2018. The official approach phase began on August 16, 2018, and continued through December 24, 2018. New Horizonsmade its first detection of Arrokoth on August 16, 2018, from a distance of 172 million km (107 million mi). At that time, Arrokoth was visible at magnitude 20 against a crowded stellar background in the direction of the constellationSagittarius. The Core phase began a week before the encounter and continued for two days after the encounter. The spacecraft flew by the object at a speed of 51,500 km/h (32,000 mph; 14.3 km/s) and within 3,500 km (2,200 mi).The majority of the science data was collected within 48 hours of the closest approach in a phase called the Inner Core.Closest approach occurred January 1, 2019, at 05:33UTCSCETat which point the probe was43.4AUfrom theSun.At this distance, the one-way transit time for radio signals between Earth andNew Horizonswas six hours.Confirmation that the craft had succeeded in filling its digital recorders occurred when data arrived on Earth ten hours later, at 15:29 UTC. After the encounter, preliminary, high-priority data was sent to Earth on January 1 and 2, 2019. On January 9,New Horizonsreturned to a spin-stabilized mode to prepare sending the remainder of its data back to Earth.This download was expected to take 20 months at a data rate of 1–2kilobits per second.As of July 2022, approximately 10% of the data was still left to be received. In April 2020,New Horizonswas used in conjunction with telescopes on Earth to take pictures of nearby starsProxima CentauriandWolf 359; the images from each vantage point – over 6.4 billion km (4 billion miles) apart – were compared to produce "the first demonstration of an easily observablestellar parallax." Images taken by the LORRI camera whileNew Horizonswas 42 to 45 AU from the Sun were used to measure the cosmic optical background, the visible light analog of thecosmic microwave background, in seven high galactic latitude fields. At that distanceNew Horizonssaw a sky ten times darker than the sky seen by theHubble Space Telescopebecause of the absence of diffuse background sky brightness from thezodiacal lightin the inner solar system. These measurements indicate that the total amount of light emitted by all galaxies at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths may be lower than previously thought. The spacecraft reached a distance of 50 AU (7.5 billion km; 4.6 billion mi) on April 17, 2021, at 12:42 UTC, a feat performed only four times before, byPioneer 10,Pioneer 11,Voyager 1, andVoyager 2.Voyager 1is the farthest spacecraft from the Sun, more than 152 AU (22.7 billion km; 14.1 billion mi) away whenNew Horizonsreached its landmark in 2021.The support team continued to use the spacecraft in 2021 to study theheliosphericenvironment (plasma, dust and gas) and to study other Kuiper Belt objects. In 2025, the first map of allLyman-Alpha emissionsin the Milky Way galaxy was published, based onNew Horizonsobservations. After the spacecraft passed Arrokoth, the instruments continue to have enough power to be operational until the 2030s. Team leader Alan Stern stated there is potential for a third flyby in the 2020s at the outer edges of the Kuiper belt.This depends on a suitable Kuiper belt object being found or confirmed close enough to the spacecraft's current trajectory. Since May 2020, theNew Horizonsteam has been using time on theSubaru Telescopeto look for suitable candidates within the spacecraft's proximity. As of June 2024, no suitable targets have been found. Beginning in fiscal year 2025,New Horizonswill focus on specificheliophysicsdata, as stated by NASA in September 2023. It will remain available for a flyby of a different target until it leaves the Kuiper belt in 2028. New Horizonsmay also take a picture of Earth from its distance in the Kuiper belt, but only after completing all planned KBO flybys and imaging Uranus and Neptune.This is because pointing a camera towards Earth could cause the camera to be damaged by sunlight,as none ofNew Horizons'cameras have an active shutter mechanism. New Horizonshas been called "the fastest spacecraft ever launched"because it left Earth at 16.26 kilometers per second (58,536 km/h; 36,373 mph).It is also the first spacecraft launched directly into a solar escape trajectory, which requires an approximate speed while near Earth of 16.5 km/s (59,000 km/h; 37,000 mph),[b]plus additionaldelta-vto coverairandgravity drag, all to be provided by the launch vehicle. As of May 2, 2024, the spacecraft is 58.80 AU (8.796 billion km; 5.466 billion mi) from the Sun traveling at 13.68 kilometres per second (49,200 km/h; 30,600 mph). However, it is not the fastest spacecraft to leave the Solar System. As of July 2023[update], this record is held byVoyager 1, traveling at 16.985 km/s (61,146 km/h; 37,994 mph) relative to the Sun.Voyager 1attained greaterhyperbolic excess velocitythanNew Horizonsdue togravity assistsby Jupiter and Saturn.  WhenNew Horizonsreaches the distance of 100 AU (15 billion km; 9.3 billion mi), it will be traveling at about 13 km/s (47,000 km/h; 29,000 mph), around 4 km/s (14,000 km/h; 8,900 mph) slower thanVoyager 1at that distance.TheParker Solar Probecan also be measured as the fastest object, because of itsorbital speedrelative to the Sun atperihelion: 191 km/s (690,000 km/h; 430,000 mph).[c]Because it remains in solar orbit, itsspecific orbital energyrelative to the Sun is lower thanNew Horizonsand otherartificial objects escaping the Solar System. New Horizons'Star 48Bthird stage is also on ahyperbolic escape trajectoryfrom the Solar System and reached Jupiter before theNew Horizonsspacecraft; it was expected to cross Pluto's orbit on October 15, 2015.Because it was not in controlled flight, it did not receive the correct gravity assist and passed within 200 million km (120 million mi) of Pluto.TheCentaursecond stage did not achieve solar escape velocity and remains in a heliocentric orbit.

Cassini–Huygens(/kəˈsiːniˈhɔɪɡənz/kə-SEE-neeHOY-gənz), commonly calledCassini, was aspace-researchmission byNASA, theEuropean Space Agency(ESA), and theItalian Space Agency(ASI) to send aspace probeto study theplanetSaturnand its system, including itsringsandnatural satellites. TheFlagship-classrobotic spacecraftcomprised both NASA'sCassinispace probe and ESA'sHuygenslander, which landed on Saturn's largest moon,Titan.Cassiniwas the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter its orbit, where it stayed from 2004 to 2017. The two craft took their names from the astronomersGiovanni CassiniandChristiaan Huygens. Launched aboard aTitan IVB/Centauron October 15, 1997,Cassiniwas active in space for nearly 20 years, spending its final 13 years orbiting Saturn and studying the planet and its system afterentering orbiton July 1, 2004. The voyage to Saturn includedflybysofVenus(April 1998 and July 1999),Earth(August 1999), the asteroid2685 Masursky, andJupiter(December 2000). The mission ended on September 15, 2017, whenCassini's trajectory took it into Saturn's upper atmosphere and it burned upin order to prevent any risk of contaminating Saturn's moons, which might have offered habitable environments to stowaway terrestrial microbes on the spacecraft.The mission was successful beyond expectations – NASA'sPlanetary Science DivisionDirector,Jim Green, describedCassini-Huygensas a "mission of firsts"that has revolutionized human understanding of the Saturn system, including its moons and rings, and our understanding of where life might be found in theSolar System. Scientists and individuals from 27 countries made up the joint team responsible for designing, building, flying and collecting data from theCassiniorbiter and theHuygensprobe. Cassini's planners originally scheduled a mission of four years, from June 2004 to May 2008. The mission was extended for another two years until September 2010, branded theCassini Equinox Mission. The mission was extended a second and final time with theCassini Solstice Mission, lasting another seven years until September 15, 2017, on which dateCassiniwas de-orbited to burn up in Saturn's upper atmosphere.TheHuygensmodule traveled withCassiniuntil its separation from the probe on December 25, 2004; Huygens landed byparachuteon Titan on January 14, 2005. The separation was facilitated by the SED (Spin/Eject device), which provided a relative separation speed of 0.35 metres per second (1.1 ft/s) and a spin rate of 7.5 rpm.It returned data to Earth for around 90 minutes, using the orbiter as a relay. This was the firstlandingever accomplished in the outer Solar System and the first landing on a moon other than Earth's Moon. At the end of its mission, theCassinispacecraft executed its "Grand Finale": a number of risky passes through the gaps between Saturn and its inner rings.This phase aimed to maximizeCassini'sscientific outcome before the spacecraft was intentionally destroyedto prevent potential contamination of Saturn's moons ifCassiniwere to unintentionally crash into them when maneuvering the probe was no longer possible due to power loss or other communication issues at the end of its operational lifespan.Cassini'satmospheric entryon Saturn ended the mission, but analysis of the returned data will continue for many years. NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratoryin the United States, where the orbiter was assembled, managed the mission. TheEuropean Space Research and Technology CentredevelopedHuygens. The centre's prime contractor,Aérospatialeof France (part ofThales Alenia Spacefrom 2005), assembled the probe with equipment and instruments supplied by many European countries (includingHuygens'sbatteries and two scientific instruments from the United States). TheItalian Space Agency(ASI) provided theCassiniorbiter'shigh-gain radio antenna, with the incorporation of a low-gain antenna (to ensure telecommunications with the Earth for the entire duration of the mission), a compact and lightweightradar, which also used the high-gain antenna and served as asynthetic-aperture radar, aradar altimeter, aradiometer, theradio science subsystem(RSS), and thevisible-channel portion VIMS-V of VIMSspectrometer. NASAprovided the VIMS infrared counterpart, as well as the Main Electronic Assembly, which included electronic sub-assemblies provided byCNESof France.On April 16, 2008, NASA announced a two-year extension of the funding for ground operations of this mission, at which point it was renamed theCassiniEquinox Mission.It was extended again in February 2010 as theCassiniSolstice Mission. The mission consisted of two main elements: the ASI/NASACassiniorbiter, named for the Italian astronomerGiovanni Domenico Cassini, discoverer ofSaturn's ringdivisions and four of its satellites; and the ESA-developedHuygensprobe, named for the Dutch astronomer, mathematician and physicistChristiaan Huygens, discoverer of Titan. The mission was commonly called Saturn Orbiter Titan Probe (SOTP) during gestation, both as aMariner Mark IImission and generically. Cassini-Huygenswas aFlagship-classmission to the outer planets.The other planetary flagships includeGalileo,Voyager, andViking. Cassinihad several objectives, including: Cassini–Huygenswas launched on October 15, 1997, fromCape Canaveral Air Force Station'sSpace Launch Complex 40using aU.S. Air ForceTitan IVB/Centaurrocket. The complete launcher was made up of a two-stageTitan IVbooster rocket, two strap-on solidrocket engines, the Centaur upper stage, and a payload enclosure, or fairing. The total cost of this scientific exploration mission was about US$3.26billion, including $1.4 billion for pre-launch development, $704millionfor mission operations, $54 million for tracking and $422 million for thelaunch vehicle. The United States contributed $2.6 billion (80%), the ESA $500 million (15%), and the ASI $160 million (5%).However, these figures are from the press kit which was prepared in October 2000. They do not include inflation over the course of a very long mission, nor do they include the cost of the extended missions. The primary mission forCassiniwas completed on July 30, 2008. The mission was extended to June 2010 (CassiniEquinox Mission).This studied the Saturn system in detail during the planet'sequinox, which happened in August 2009. On February 3, 2010, NASA announced another extension forCassini, lasting 61⁄2years until 2017, ending at the time of summer solstice in Saturn's northern hemisphere (CassiniSolstice Mission). The extension enabled another 155 revolutions around the planet, 54 flybys of Titan and 11 flybys ofEnceladus.In 2017, an encounter with Titan changed its orbit in such a way that, at closest approach to Saturn, it was only 3,000 km (1,900 mi) above the planet's cloudtops, below the inner edge of theD ring. This sequence of "proximal orbits" ended when its final encounter with Titan sent the probe into Saturn's atmosphere to be destroyed. Selected destinations (ordered largest to smallest but not to scale) Cassini–Huygens's origins date to 1982, when theEuropean Science Foundationand the AmericanNational Academy of Sciencesformed aworking groupto investigate future cooperative missions. Two European scientists suggested a paired Saturn Orbiter and Titan Probe as a possible joint mission. In 1983, NASA'sSolar System Exploration Committeerecommended the same Orbiter and Probe pair as a core NASA project. NASA and theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) performed a joint study of the potential mission from 1984 to 1985. ESA continued with its own study in 1986, while the American astronautSally Ride, in her influential 1987 reportNASA Leadership and America's Future in Space, also examined and approved of theCassinimission. While Ride's report described the Saturn orbiter and probe as a NASA solo mission, in 1988 the Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications of NASA, Len Fisk, returned to the idea of a joint NASA and ESA mission. He wrote to his counterpart at ESA, Roger Bonnet, strongly suggesting that ESA choose theCassinimission from the three candidates at hand and promising that NASA would commit to the mission as soon as ESA did. At the time, NASA was becoming more sensitive to the strain that had developed between the American and European space programs as a result of European perceptions that NASA had not treated it like an equal during previous collaborations. NASA officials and advisers involved in promoting and planningCassini–Huygensattempted to correct this trend by stressing their desire to evenly share any scientific and technology benefits resulting from the mission. In part, this newfound spirit of cooperation with Europe was driven by a sense of competition with theSoviet Union, which had begun to cooperate more closely with Europe as ESA drew further away from NASA. Late in 1988, ESA chose Cassini–Huygens as its next major mission and the following year the program received major funding in the US. The collaboration not only improved relations between the two space programs but also helpedCassini–Huygenssurvive congressional budget cuts in the United States.Cassini–Huygenscame under fire politically in both 1992 and 1994, but NASA successfully persuaded theUnited States Congressthat it would be unwise to halt the project after ESA had already poured funds into development because frustration on brokenspace explorationpromises might spill over into other areas of foreign relations. The project proceeded politically smoothly after 1994, although citizens' groups concerned about the potential environmental impact a launch failure might have (because of its plutonium power source) attempted to derail it through protests and lawsuits until and past its 1997 launch. The spacecraft was planned to be the second three-axis stabilized,RTG-poweredMariner Mark II, a class of spacecraft developed for missions beyond the orbit ofMars, after theComet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby(CRAF) mission, but budget cuts and project rescopings forced NASA to terminate CRAF development to saveCassini. As a result,Cassinibecame more specialized. The Mariner Mark II series was cancelled. The combined orbiter and probe was at the time the third-largest uncrewedinterplanetaryspacecraft ever successfully launched, behind thePhobos 1and2Mars probes, as well as being among the most complex;NASA'sEuropa Clipperbecame the new third-largest probe upon its launch in 2024.The orbiter had a mass of 2,150 kg (4,740 lb), the probe 350 kg (770 lb) including 30 kg (66 lb) of probe support equipment left on the orbiter. With the launch vehicle adapter and 3,132 kg (6,905 lb) of propellants at launch, the spacecraft had a mass of 5,600 kg (12,300 lb). TheCassinispacecraft was 6.8 meters (22 ft) high and 4 meters (13 ft) wide. Itsbuswas adodecagonal prismatop a conicalfrustumconnecting it to a cylinder containing the propellant tanks, to which the RTGs andHuygenswere attached.Spacecraft complexity was increased by itstrajectory(flight path) to Saturn, and by the ambitious science at its destination.Cassinihad 1,630 interconnectedelectronic components, 22,000 wire connections, and 14 kilometers (8.7 mi) of cabling.The core control computer CPU was a redundant system using theMIL-STD-1750Ainstruction set architecture. The main propulsion system consisted of one prime and one backupR-4Dbipropellant rocket engine. The thrust of each engine was 490N(110lbf) and the total spacecraftdelta-vwas 2,352 m/s (5,260 mph).Smaller monopropellant rockets provided attitude control. Cassiniwas powered by 32.7 kg (72 lb) of nuclear fuel, mainlyplutonium dioxide(containing 28.3 kg (62 lb) of pureplutonium).The heat from the material'sradioactive decaywas turned into electricity.Huygenswas supported byCassiniduring cruise, but used chemical batteries when independent. The probe contained a DVD with more than 616,400 signatures from citizens in 81 countries, collected in a public campaign. Until September 2017 theCassiniprobe continued orbiting Saturn at a distance of between 8.2 and 10.2astronomical units(1.23×109and 1.53×109km; 760,000,000 and 950,000,000mi) from the Earth. It took 68 to 84 minutes for radio signals totravelfrom Earth to the spacecraft, and vice versa. Thus ground controllers could not give "real-time" instructions for daily operations or for unexpected events. Even if response were immediate, more than two hours would have passed between the occurrence of a problem and the reception of the engineers' response by the satellite. Cassini's instrumentation consisted of: asynthetic aperture radarmapper, acharge-coupled deviceimaging system, a visible/infraredmappingspectrometer, a composite infrared spectrometer, acosmic dustanalyzer, a radio andplasmawave experiment, a plasma spectrometer, anultravioletimaging spectrograph, amagnetosphericimaging instrument, amagnetometerand anion/neutralmass spectrometer.Telemetryfrom the communicationsantennaand other special transmitters (anS-bandtransmitter and a dual-frequencyKa-bandsystem) was also used to make observations of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and to measure thegravityfields of the planet and its satellites. The HSP channel is designed to observe starlight that passes through Saturn's rings (known as stellar occultations) in order to understand the structure and optical depth of the rings.Stellar occultation data from both the HSP and FUV channels confirmed the existence of water vapor plumes at the south pole of Enceladus, as well as characterized the composition of the plumes. Because of Saturn's distance from the Sun,solar arrayswere not feasible as power sources for this space probe.To generate enough power, such arrays would have been too large and too heavy.Instead, theCassiniorbiter was powered by threeGPHS-RTGradioisotope thermoelectric generators, which use heat from the decay of about 33 kg (73 lb) ofplutonium-238(in the form ofplutonium dioxide) to generate direct current electricity viathermoelectrics.The RTGs on theCassinimission have the same design as those used on theNew Horizons,Galileo, andUlyssesspace probes, and they were designed to have very long operational lifetimes.At the end of the nominal 11-yearCassinimission, they were still able to produce 600 to 700 watts of electrical power.(Leftover hardware from theCassiniRTG Program was modified and used to power theNew Horizonsmission toPlutoand theKuiper belt, which was designed and launched later.) Power distributionwas accomplished by 192solid-statepower switches, which also functioned ascircuit breakersin the event of an overload condition. The switches usedMOSFETsthat featured better efficiency and a longer lifetime as compared to conventional switches, while at the same time eliminatingtransients. However, these solid-state circuit breakers were prone to erroneous tripping (presumably from cosmic rays), requiring them to reset and causing losses in experimental data. To gainmomentumwhile already in flight, the trajectory of theCassinimission included severalgravitational slingshotmaneuvers: two fly-by passes ofVenus, one more of the Earth, and then one of the planetJupiter. The terrestrial flyby was the final instance when the probe posed any conceivable danger to human beings. The maneuver was successful, withCassinipassing by 1,171 km (728 mi) above the Earth on August 18, 1999.Had there been any malfunction causing the probe to collide with the Earth, NASA's complete environmental impact study estimated that, in the worst case (with an acute angle of entry in whichCassiniwould gradually burn up), a significant fraction of the 33 kgof nuclear fuel inside the RTGs would have been dispersed into the Earth's atmosphere so that up to five billion people (i.e. almost the entire terrestrial population) could have been exposed, causing up to an estimated 5,000 additional cancer deaths over the subsequent decades(0.0005 per cent, i.e. a fraction 0.000005, of a billion cancer deaths expected anyway from other causes; the product is incorrectly calculated elsewhereas 500,000 deaths).  However, the chance of this happening were estimated to be less than one in one million, i.e. a chance of one person dying (assuming 5,000 deaths) as less than 1 in 200. NASA's risk analysis to use plutonium was publicly criticized byMichio Kakuon the grounds that casualties, property damage, and lawsuits resulting from a possible accident, as well as the potential use of other energy sources, such as solar and fuel cells, were underestimated. TheCassinispacecraft was capable of transmitting in several different telemetry formats. The telemetry subsystem is perhaps the most important subsystem, because without it there could be no data return. The telemetry was developed from the ground up, due to the spacecraft using a more modern set of computers than previous missions.Therefore,Cassiniwas the first spacecraft to adoptmini-packetsto reduce the complexity of the Telemetry Dictionary, and the software development process led to the creation of a Telemetry Manager for the mission. There were around 1088 channels (in 67 mini-packets) assembled in theCassiniTelemetry Dictionary. Out of these 67 lower complexity mini-packets, 6 mini-packets contained the subsystem covariance and Kalman gain elements (161 measurements), not used during normal mission operations. This left 947 measurements in 61 mini-packets. A total of seven telemetry maps corresponding to 7 AACS telemetry modes were constructed. These modes are: (1) Record; (2) Nominal Cruise; (3) Medium Slow Cruise; (4) Slow Cruise; (5) Orbital Ops; (6) Av; (7) ATE (Attitude Estimator) Calibration. These 7 maps cover all spacecraft telemetry modes. TheHuygensprobe, supplied by theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) and named after the 17th century Dutch astronomer who first discovered Titan,Christiaan Huygens, scrutinized the clouds, atmosphere, and surface of Saturn's moon Titan in its descent on January 15, 2005. It was designed to enter and brake in Titan's atmosphere and parachute a fully instrumented robotic laboratory down to the surface. The probe system consisted of the probe itself which descended to Titan, and the probe support equipment (PSE) which remained attached to the orbiting spacecraft. The PSE includes electronics that track the probe, recover the data gathered during its descent, and process and deliver the data to the orbiter that transmits it to Earth. The core control computer CPU was a redundantMIL-STD-1750Acontrol system. The data were transmitted by a radio link betweenHuygensandCassiniprovided by Probe Data Relay Subsystem (PDRS). As the probe's mission could not be telecommanded from Earth because of the great distance, it was automatically managed by the Command Data Management Subsystem (CDMS). The PDRS and CDMS were provided by theItalian Space Agency(ASI). AfterCassini'slaunch, it was discovered that data sent from theHuygensprobe toCassiniorbiter (and then re-transmitted to Earth) would be largely unreadable. The cause was that thebandwidthof signal processing electronics was too narrow and the anticipatedDoppler shiftbetween the lander and the mother craft would put the signals out of the system's range. Thus,Cassini'sreceiver would be unable to receive the data fromHuygensduring its descent to Titan. A work-around was found to recover the mission. The trajectory ofCassiniwas altered to reduce the line of sight velocity and therefore the doppler shift.Cassini's subsequent trajectory was identical to the previously planned one, although the change replaced two orbits prior to theHuygensmission with three, shorter orbits. TheCassinispace probe performed twogravitational-assist flybysofVenuson April 26, 1998, and June 24, 1999. These flybys provided the space probe with enough momentum to travel all the way out to theasteroid belt, while the Sun's gravity pulled the space probe back into the inner Solar System. On August 18, 1999, at 03:28 UTC, the craft made a gravitational-assist flyby of the Earth. One hour and 20 minutes before closest approach,Cassinimade its closest approach to the Earth's Moon at 377,000 kilometers, and it took a series of calibration photos. On January 23, 2000,Cassiniperformed a flyby of theasteroid2685 Masurskyat around 10:00 UTC. It took photosin the period five to seven hours before the flyby at a distance of 1.6×10^6km (0.99×10^6mi) and a diameter of 15 to 20 km (9.3 to 12.4 mi) was estimated for the asteroid. Cassinimade its closest approach to Jupiter on December 30, 2000, at 9.7 million kilometers, and made many scientific measurements. About 26,000 images of Jupiter, itsfaint rings, and itsmoonswere taken during the six-month flyby. It produced the most detailed global color portrait of the planet yet (see image at right), in which the smallest visible features are approximately 60 km (37 mi) across. A major finding of the flyby, announced on March 6, 2003, was of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation. Dark "belts" alternate with light "zones" in the atmosphere, and scientists had long considered the zones, with their pale clouds, to be areas of upwelling air, partly because many clouds on Earth form where air is rising. But analysis ofCassiniimagery showed that individual storm cells of upwelling bright-white clouds, too small to see from Earth, pop up almost without exception in the dark belts. According toAnthony Del Genioof NASA'sGoddard Institute for Space Studies, "the belts must be the areas of net-rising atmospheric motion on Jupiter, [so] the net motion in the zones has to be sinking". Other atmospheric observations included a swirling dark oval of high atmospheric haze, about the size of theGreat Red Spot, near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, with adjacent bands moving in opposite directions. The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter'srings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originate as ejecta frommicrometeoriteimpacts on Jupiter's moons, probablyMetisandAdrastea. On October 10, 2003, the mission's science team announced the results of tests ofAlbert Einstein'sgeneral theory of relativity, performed by usingradio wavestransmitted from theCassinispace probe.The radio scientists measured afrequencyshift in the radio waves to and from the spacecraft, as they passed close to the Sun. According to the general theory of relativity, a massive object like theSuncausesspace-timeto curve, causing a beam of radiowaves travelling out of itsgravitational wellto decrease infrequencyand radiowaves travelling into the gravitational well to increase in frequency, referred to asgravitational redshift/ blueshift. Although some measurable deviations from the values calculated using thegeneral theory of relativityare predicted by some unusual cosmological models, no such deviations were found by this experiment. Previous tests using radiowaves transmitted by theVikingandVoyagerspace probes were in agreement with the calculated values from general relativity to within an accuracy of one part in one thousand. The more refined measurements from theCassinispace probe experiment improved this accuracy to about one part in 51,000.[a]The data firmly support Einstein's general theory of relativity. In total, theCassinimission discovered seven new moons orbiting Saturn.Using images taken byCassini, researchers discoveredMethone,PalleneandPolydeucesin 2004,althoughlater analysisrevealed thatVoyager 2had photographed Pallene in its 1981 flyby of the ringed planet. On May 1, 2005, a new moon was discovered byCassiniin theKeeler gap. It was given the designation S/2005 S 1 before being namedDaphnis. A fifth new moon was discovered byCassinion May 30, 2007, and was provisionally labeled S/2007 S 4. It is now known asAnthe. A press release on February 3, 2009, showed a sixth new moon found byCassini. The moon is approximately 500 m (0.3 mi) in diameter within the G-ring of the ring system of Saturn, and is now namedAegaeon(formerly S/2008 S 1).A press release on November 2, 2009, mentions the seventh new moon found byCassinion July 26, 2009. It is presently labeledS/2009 S 1and is approximately 300 m (980 ft) in diameter in the B-ring system. On April 14, 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon in Saturn'sA Ring. On June 11, 2004,Cassiniflew by the moonPhoebe.  This was the first opportunity for close-up studies of this moon (Voyager 2performed a distant flyby in 1981 but returned no detailed images). It also wasCassini'sonly possible flyby for Phoebe due to the mechanics of the available orbits around Saturn. The first close-up images were received on June 12, 2004, and mission scientists immediately realized that the surface of Phoebe looks different from asteroids visited by spacecraft. Parts of the heavily cratered surface look very bright in those pictures, and it is currently believed that a large amount of water ice exists under its immediate surface. In an announcement on June 28, 2004,Cassiniprogram scientists described the measurement of the rotational period of Saturn.Because there are no fixed features on the surface that can be used to obtain this period, the repetition of radio emissions was used. This new data agreed with the latest values measured from Earth, and constituted a puzzle to the scientists. It turns out that the radio rotational period had changed since it was first measured in 1980 byVoyager 1, and it was now 6 minutes longer. This, however, does not indicate a change in the overall spin of the planet. It is thought to be due to variations in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere at the latitudes which are magnetically connected to the radio source region. In 2019 NASA announced Saturn's rotational period as 10 hours, 33 minutes, 38 seconds, calculated using Saturnian ring seismology. Vibrations from Saturn's interior cause oscillations in its gravitational field. This energy is absorbed by ring particles in specific locations, where it accumulates until it is released in a wave.Scientists used data from more than 20 of these waves to construct a family of models of Saturn's interior, providing basis for calculating its rotational period. On July 1, 2004, the spacecraft flew through the gap between theF and G ringsand achievedorbit, after a seven-year voyage.It was the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn. The Saturn Orbital Insertion (SOI) maneuver performed byCassiniwas complex, requiring the craft to orient its High-Gain Antenna away from Earth and along its flight path, to shield its instruments from particles in Saturn's rings. Once the craft crossed the ring plane, it had to rotate again to point its engine along its flight path, and then the engine fired to decelerate the craft by 622 m/s to allow Saturn to capture it.Cassiniwas captured by Saturn's gravity at around 8:54 pmPacific Daylight Timeon June 30, 2004. During the maneuverCassinipassed within 20,000 km (12,000 mi) of Saturn's cloud tops. When Cassini was in Saturnian orbit, departure from the Saturn system was evaluated in 2008 during end of mission planning.[clarification needed] Cassinihad its first flyby ofSaturn'slargest moon,Titan, on July 2, 2004, a day after orbit insertion, when it approached to within 339,000 km (211,000 mi) of Titan. Images taken through special filters (able to see through the moon's global haze) showed south polar clouds thought to be composed ofmethaneand surface features with widely differing brightness. On October 27, 2004, the spacecraft executed the first of the 45 planned close flybys of Titan when it passed a mere 1,200 km (750 mi) above the moon. Almost fourgigabitsof data were collected and transmitted to Earth, including the first radar images of the moon's haze-enshrouded surface. It revealed the surface of Titan (at least the area covered by radar) to be relatively level, with topography reaching no more than about 50 m (160 ft) in altitude. The flyby provided a remarkable increase in imaging resolution over previous coverage. Images with up to 100 times better resolution were taken and are typical of resolutions planned for subsequent Titan flybys. Cassini collected pictures of Titan and the lakes of methane were similar to the lakes of water on Earth. Cassinireleased theHuygensprobe on December 25, 2004, by means of a spring and spiral rails intended to rotate the probe for greater stability. It entered the atmosphere of Titan on January 14, 2005, and after a two-and-a-half-hour descent landed on solid ground.AlthoughCassinisuccessfully relayed 350 of the pictures that it received fromHuygensof its descent and landing site, a malfunction in one of the communications channels resulted in the loss of a further 350 pictures. During the first two close flybys of the moonEnceladusin 2005,Cassinidiscovered a deflection in the local magnetic field that is characteristic for the existence of a thin but significant atmosphere. Other measurements obtained at that time point to ionized water vapor as its main constituent.Cassinialso observed water ice geysers erupting from the south pole of Enceladus, which gives more credibility to the idea that Enceladus is supplying the particles of Saturn's E ring. Mission scientists began to suspect that there may be pockets of liquid water near the surface of the moon that fuel the eruptions. On March 12, 2008,Cassinimade a close fly-by of Enceladus, passing within 50 km of the moon's surface.The spacecraft passed through the plumes extending from its southern geysers, detecting water, carbon dioxide and various hydrocarbons with its mass spectrometer, while also mapping surface features that are at much higher temperature than their surroundings with the infrared spectrometer.Cassiniwas unable to collect data with its cosmic dust analyzer due to an unknown software malfunction. On November 21, 2009,Cassinimade its eighth flyby of Enceladus,this time with a different geometry, approaching within 1,600 km (990 mi) of the surface. The Composite Infrared Spectrograph (CIRS) instrument produced a map of thermal emissions from theBaghdad Sulcus 'tiger stripe'. The data returned helped create a detailed and high resolution mosaic image of the southern part of the moon's Saturn-facing hemisphere. On April 3, 2014, nearly ten years afterCassinientered Saturn's orbit, NASA reported evidence of a large salty internal ocean of liquid water in Enceladus. The presence of an internal salty ocean in contact with the moon's rocky core, places Enceladus "among the most likely places in the Solar System to hostalien microbial life".On June 30, 2014, NASA celebrated ten years ofCassiniexploring Saturn andits moons, highlighting the discovery of water activity on Enceladus among other findings. In September 2015, NASA announced that gravitational and imaging data fromCassiniwere used to analyze thelibrationsof Enceladus's orbit and determined that the moon's surface is not rigidly joined to its core, concluding that the underground ocean must therefore be global in extent. On October 28, 2015,Cassiniperformed a close flyby of Enceladus, coming within  49 km (30 mi) of the surface, and passing through theicy plume above the south pole. On December 14, 2023, astronomers reported the first time discovery, in theplumesof Enceladus, ofhydrogen cyanide, a possible chemical essential forlifeas we know it, as well as otherorganic molecules, some of which are yet to be better identified and understood. According to the researchers, "these [newly discovered] compounds could potentially support extantmicrobial communitiesor drive complexorganic synthesisleading to theorigin of life". In May 2005,Cassinibegan a series ofradio occultationexperiments, to measure the size-distribution of particles inSaturn's rings, and measure the atmosphere of Saturn itself. For over four months, the craft completed orbits designed for this purpose. During these experiments, it flew behind the ring plane of Saturn, as seen from Earth, and transmitted radio waves through the particles. The radio signals received on Earth were analyzed, for frequency, phase, and power shift of the signal to determine the structure of the rings. In images captured September 5, 2005,Cassinidetected spokes in Saturn's rings,previously seen only by the visual observer Stephen James O'Meara in 1977 and then confirmed by theVoyagerspace probes in the early 1980s. Radar images obtained on July 21, 2006, appear to show lakes ofliquid hydrocarbon(such asmethaneandethane) in Titan's northern latitudes. This is the first discovery of currently existing lakes anywhere besides on Earth. The lakes range in size from one to one-hundred kilometers across. On March 13, 2007, theJet Propulsion Laboratoryannounced that it had found strong evidence of seas of methane and ethane in the northern hemisphere of Titan. At least one of these is larger than any of theGreat Lakesin North America. In November 2006, scientists discovered a storm at the south pole of Saturn with a distincteyewall. This is characteristic of ahurricaneon Earth and had never been seen on another planet before. Unlike aterrestrialhurricane, the storm appears to be stationary at the pole. The storm is 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across, and 70 km (43 mi) high, with winds blowing at 560 km/h (350 mph). On September 10, 2007,Cassinicompleted its flyby of the strange, two-toned, walnut-shaped moon,Iapetus. Images were taken from 1,600 km (1,000 mi) above the surface. As it was sending the images back to Earth, it was hit by acosmic raythat forced it to temporarily entersafe mode. All of the data from the flyby was recovered. On April 15, 2008,Cassinireceived funding for a 27-month extended mission. It consisted of 60 more orbits ofSaturn, with 21 more close Titan flybys, seven of Enceladus, six of Mimas, eight of Tethys, and one targeted flyby each ofDione,Rhea, andHelene.The extended mission began on July 1, 2008, and was renamed theCassini Equinox Missionas the mission coincided with Saturn'sequinox. A proposal was submitted to NASA for a second mission extension (September 2010 – May 2017), provisionally named the extended-extended mission or XXM.This ($60M pa) was approved in February 2010 and renamed theCassini Solstice Mission.It includedCassiniorbiting Saturn 155 more times, conducting 54 additional flybys ofTitanand 11 more of Enceladus. On October 25, 2012,Cassiniwitnessed the aftermath of the massiveGreat White Spotstorm that recurs roughly every 30 years on Saturn.Data from the composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS) instrument indicated a powerful discharge from the storm that caused a temperature spike in the stratosphere of Saturn 83 K (83 °C; 149 °F) above normal. Simultaneously, a huge increase inethylenegas was detected by NASA researchers at Goddard Research Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.  Ethylene is a colorless gas that is highly uncommon on Saturn and is produced both naturally and through man-made sources on Earth. The storm that produced this discharge was first observed by the spacecraft on December 5, 2010, in Saturn's northern hemisphere. The storm is the first of its kind to be observed by a spacecraft in orbit around Saturn as well as the first to be observed at thermal infrared wavelengths, allowing scientists to observe the temperature of Saturn's atmosphere and track phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye. The spike of ethylene gas that was produced by the storm reached levels that were 100 times more than those thought possible for Saturn. Scientists have also determined that the storm witnessed was the largest, hottest stratospheric vortex ever detected in the Solar System, initially being larger than Jupiter'sGreat Red Spot. On December 21, 2012,Cassiniobserved atransit of Venusacross the Sun. The VIMS instrument analyzed sunlight passing through the Venusian atmosphere. VIMS previously observed the transit of exoplanetHD 189733 b. On July 19, 2013, the probe was pointed towards Earth to capture an image of the Earth and theMoon, as part of a natural light, multi-image portrait of the entire Saturn system. The event was unique as it was the first time NASA informed the public that a long-distance photo was being taken in advance.The imaging team said they wanted people to smile and wave to the skies, withCassiniscientistCarolyn Porcodescribing the moment as a chance to "celebrate life on thePale Blue Dot". On February 10, 2015, theCassinispacecraft visitedRheamore closely, coming within 47,000 km (29,000 mi).The spacecraft observed the moon with its cameras producing some of the highest resolution color images yet of Rhea. Cassiniperformed its latest flyby of Saturn's moonHyperionon May 31, 2015, at a distance of about 34,000 km (21,000 mi). Cassiniperformed its last flyby of Saturn's moonDioneon August 17, 2015, at a distance of about 475 km (295 mi). A previous flyby was performed on June 16. Between 2012 and 2016, the persistent hexagonal cloud pattern at Saturn's north pole changed from a mostly blue color to more of a golden color.One theory for this is a seasonal change: extended exposure to sunlight may be creating haze as the pole swivels toward the Sun.It was previously noted that there was less blue color overall on Saturn between 2004 and 2008. Cassini'send involved a series of close Saturn passes, approaching within therings, then an entry into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15, 2017, to destroy the spacecraft.This method was chosen to ensureprotectionand prevent biological contamination to any of the moons of Saturn thought to offer potentialhabitability. In 2008 a number of options were evaluated to achieve this goal, each with varying funding, scientific, and technical challenges. A short period Saturn impact for an end of mission was rated "excellent" with the reasons "D-ring option satisfies unachieved AO goals;[definition needed]cheap and easily achievable" while collision with an icy moon was rated "good" for being "cheap and achievable anywhere/time". There were problems in 2013–14 about NASA receiving U.S. government funding for the Grand Finale. The two phases of the Grand Finale ended up being the equivalent of having two separateDiscovery-classmissions in that the Grand Finale was completely different from the mainCassiniregular mission. The U.S. government in late 2014 approved the Grand Finale at the cost of $200 million. This was far cheaper than building two new probes in separateDiscovery-class missions. On November 29, 2016, the spacecraft performed a Titan flyby that took it to the gateway of F-ring orbits: This was the start of the Grand Finale phase culminating in its impact with the planet.A final Titan flyby on April 22, 2017, changed the orbit again to fly through the gap between Saturn and its inner ring days later on April 26.Cassinipassed about 3,100 km (1,900 mi) above Saturn's cloud layer and 320 km (200 mi) from the visible edge of the inner ring; it successfully took images of Saturn's atmosphere and began returning data the next day.After a further 22 orbits through the gap, the mission was ended with a dive into Saturn's atmosphere on September 15; signal was lost at 11:55:46 UTC  on September 15, 2017, just 30 seconds later than predicted. It is estimated that the spacecraft burned up about 45 seconds after the last transmission. In September 2018, NASA won anEmmy Awardfor Outstanding Original Interactive Program for its presentation of theCassinimission's Grand Finale at Saturn. In December 2018, Netflix aired "NASA's Cassini Mission" on their series7 Days Outdocumenting the final days of work on theCassinimission before the spacecraft crashed into Saturn to complete its Grand Finale. In January 2019, new research using data collected duringCassini'sGrand Finale phase was published: The spacecraft operation was organized around a series of missions.Each is structured according to a certain amount of funding, goals, etc.At least 260 scientists from 17 countries have worked on theCassini–Huygensmission; in addition thousands of people overall worked to design, manufacture, and launch the mission.

Curiosityis acar-sizedMars roverthat isexploringGale craterandMount SharponMarsas part ofNASA'sMars Science Laboratory(MSL) mission.Launched in 2011 and landed the following year, the rover continues to operate more than a decade after its original two-year mission. Curiositywas launched fromCape Canaveral(CCAFS) on November 26, 2011, at 15:02:00UTCand landed onAeolis Palusinside Gale crater on Mars on August 6, 2012, 05:17:57 UTC.TheBradbury Landingsite was less than 2.4 km (1.5 mi) from the center of the rover's touchdown target after a 560 million km (350 million mi) journey. Missiongoalsinclude an investigation of the Martianclimateandgeology, an assessment of whether the selected field site inside Gale has ever offeredenvironmental conditionsfavorable formicrobial life(including investigation of therole of water), andplanetary habitabilitystudies in preparation forhuman exploration. In December 2012,Curiosity'stwo-year mission was extended indefinitely.On August 6, 2022, a detailed overview of accomplishments by theCuriosityrover for the last ten years was reported.The rover is still operational, and as of 28 October 2025,Curiosityhas been active on Mars for 4703sols(4831total days;13 years, 83 days) since its landing (seecurrent status). The NASA/JPL Mars Science Laboratory/CuriosityProject Team was awarded the 2012Robert J. Collier Trophyby theNational Aeronautic Association"In recognition of the extraordinary achievements of successfully landingCuriosityon Mars, advancing the nation's technological and engineering capabilities, and significantly improving humanity's understanding of ancient Martian habitable environments."Curiosity'srover design serves as the basis for NASA's 2021Perseverancemission, which carries different scientific instruments. As established by theMars Exploration Program, the main scientific goals of the MSL mission are to help determine whether Mars could ever have supportedlife, as well as determining therole of water, and to study theclimateandgeology of Mars.The mission results will also help prepare for human exploration.To contribute to these goals, MSL has eight main scientific objectives: About one year into the surface mission, and having assessed that ancient Mars could have been hospitable to microbial life, the MSL mission objectives evolved to developing predictive models for the preservation process oforganic compoundsandbiomolecules; a branch of paleontology calledtaphonomy.The region it is set to explore has been compared to theFour Cornersregion of theNorth American west. ANASApanel selected the nameCuriosityfollowing a nationwide student contest that attracted more than 9,000 proposals via the Internet and mail. Twelve-year-old Clara Ma from Sunflower Elementary School inLenexa, Kansassubmitted the winning entry. As her prize, Ma won a trip toNASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL) inPasadena, California, where she signed her name directly onto the rover as it was being assembled. Ma wrote in her winning essay: Curiosity is an everlasting flame that burns in everyone's mind. It makes me get out of bed in the morning and wonder what surprises life will throw at me that day. Curiosity is such a powerful force. Without it, we wouldn't be who we are today. Curiosity is the passion that drives us through our everyday lives. We have become explorers and scientists with our need to ask questions and to wonder. Adjusted for inflation,Curiosityhas a life-cycle cost of US$3.2 billion dollars in 2020. By comparison, the 2021Perseverancerover has a life-cycle cost of US$2.9 billion. Curiosityis 2.9 m (9 ft 6 in) long by 2.7 m (8 ft 10 in) wide by 2.2 m (7 ft 3 in) high,larger than Mars Exploration Rovers, which are 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) long and have a mass of 174 kg (384 lb) including 6.8 kg (15 lb) of scientific instruments.In comparison toPancamon the Mars Exploration Rovers, the MastCam-34 has 1.25× higherspatial resolutionand the MastCam-100 has 3.67× higher spatial resolution. Curiosityhas an advancedpayloadof scientific equipment on Mars.It is the fourth NASA robotic rover sent to Mars since 1996. Previous successful Mars rovers areSojournerfrom theMars Pathfindermission (1997), andSpirit(2004–2010) andOpportunity(2004–2018) rovers from theMars Exploration Rovermission. Curiositycomprised 23% of the mass of the 3,893 kg (8,583 lb) spacecraft at launch. The remaining mass was discarded in the process of transport and landing. The main box-like chassis forms the Warm Electronics Box (WEB).: 52 Curiositylanded in Quad 51 (nicknamedYellowknife) ofAeolis Palusin the crater Gale.The landing site coordinates are:4°35′22″S137°26′30″E﻿ / ﻿4.5895°S 137.4417°E﻿ /-4.5895; 137.4417.The location was namedBradbury Landingon August 22, 2012, in honor of science fiction authorRay Bradbury.Gale, an estimated 3.5 to 3.8 billion-year-old impact crater, is hypothesized to have first been gradually filled in bysediments; first water-deposited, and then wind-deposited, possibly until it was completely covered. Winderosionthen scoured out the sediments, leaving an isolated 5.5 km (3.4 mi) mountain,Aeolis Mons("Mount Sharp"), at the center of the 154 km (96 mi) wide crater. Thus, it is believed that the rover may have the opportunity to study two billion years of Martian history in the sediments exposed in the mountain. Additionally, its landing site is near analluvial fan, which is hypothesized to be the result of a flow of ground water, either before the deposition of the eroded sediments or else in relatively recent geologic history. According to NASA, an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 heat-resistantbacterial sporeswere onCuriosityat launch, and as many as 1,000 times that number may not have been counted. Previous NASAMars roversbecame active only after the successful entry, descent and landing on the Martian surface.Curiosity, on the other hand, was active when it touched down on the surface of Mars, employing the rover suspension system for the final set-down. Curiositytransformed from its stowed flight configuration to a landing configuration while the MSL spacecraft simultaneously lowered it beneath the spacecraft descent stage with a 20 m (66 ft) tether from the "sky crane" system to a soft landing – wheels down – on the surface of Mars.After the rover touched down it waited two seconds to confirm that it was on solid ground then fired severalpyrotechnic fastenersactivating cable cutters on the bridle to free itself from the spacecraft descent stage. The descent stage then flew away to a crash landing, and the rover prepared itself to begin the science portion of the mission. As of August 16, 2024, the rover has driven 35.5 km (22.1 mi) from its landing site over 4703sols(Martian days). Curiosity has two full sized, vehicle system test beds (VSTB), a twin rover used for testing and problem solving,MAGGIErover (Mars Automated Giant Gizmo for Integrated Engineering) with a computer brain and aScarecrowrover without a computer brain. They are housed at the JPL Mars Yard for problem solving on simulated Mars terrain. The general sample analysis strategy begins with high-resolution cameras to look for features of interest. If a particular surface is of interest,Curiositycan vaporize a small portion of it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature to query the rock's elemental composition. If that signature is intriguing, the rover uses its long arm to swing over amicroscopeand anX-ray spectrometerto take a closer look. If the specimen warrants further analysis,Curiositycan drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either theSample Analysis at Mars(SAM) or theCheMinanalytical laboratories inside the rover. The MastCam,Mars Hand Lens Imager(MAHLI), and Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) cameras were developed byMalin Space Science Systemsand they all share common design components, such as on-boarddigital image processingboxes, 1600 × 1200charge-coupled device(CCDs), and anRGB Bayer pattern filter. In total, the rover carries 17 cameras: HazCams (8), NavCams (4), MastCams (2), MAHLI (1), MARDI (1), and ChemCam (1). The Mastcam system provides multiple spectra andtrue-colorimaging with two cameras.The cameras can take true-color images at 1600×1200pixelsand up to 10frames per secondhardware-compressed video at720p(1280×720). One Mastcam camera is the Medium Angle Camera (MAC; also referred to as Mastcam-34 and Mastcam-Left), which has a 34 mm (1.3 in)focal length, a 15°field of view, and can yield 22 cm/pixel (8.7 in/pixel) scale at 1 km (0.62 mi). The other camera in the Mastcam is the Narrow Angle Camera (NAC; also Mastcam-100 and Mastcam-Right), which has a 100 mm (3.9 in) focal length, a 5.1° field of view, and can yield 7.4 cm/pixel (2.9 in/pixel) scale at 1 km (0.62 mi).Malin also developed a pair of Mastcams with zoom lenses,but these were not included in the rover because of the time required to test the new hardware and the looming November 2011 launch date.However, the improved zoom version was selected to be incorporated on theMars 2020mission asMastcam-Z. Each camera has eight gigabytes of flash memory, which is capable of storing over 5,500 raw images, and can apply real timelossless data compression.The cameras have an autofocus capability that allows them to focus on objects from 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in) to infinity.In addition to the fixedRGBGBayer pattern filter, each camera has an eight-position filter wheel. While the Bayer filter reduces visible light throughput, all three colors are mostly transparent at wavelengths longer than 700 nm, and have minimal effect on suchinfraredobservations. ChemCamis a suite of two remote sensing instruments combined as one: alaser-induced breakdown spectroscopy(LIBS) and a Remote Micro Imager (RMI) telescope. The ChemCam instrument suite was developed by the FrenchCESRlaboratory and theLos Alamos National Laboratory.The flight model of the mast unit was delivered from the FrenchCNEStoLos Alamos National Laboratory.The purpose of the LIBS instrument is to provide elemental compositions of rock and regolith, while the RMI gives ChemCam scientists high-resolution images of the sampling areas of the rocks and regolith that LIBS targets.The LIBS instrument can target a rock or regolith sample up to 7 m (23 ft) away, vaporizing a small amount of it with about 50 to 75 5-nanosecond pulses from a 1067nminfraredlaser and then observes the spectrum of the light emitted by the vaporized rock. ChemCam has the ability to record up to 6,144 different wavelengths ofultraviolet,visible, andinfraredlight.Detection of the ball of luminous plasma is done in the visible, near-UV and near-infrared ranges, between 240 nm and 800 nm.The first initiallasertesting of the ChemCam byCuriosityon Mars was performed on a rock,N165 ("Coronation" rock), nearBradbury Landingon August 19, 2012.The ChemCam team expects to take approximately one dozen compositional measurements of rocks per day.Using the same collection optics, the RMI provides context images of the LIBS analysis spots. The RMI resolves 1 mm (0.039 in) objects at 10 m (33 ft) distance, and has a field of view covering 20 cm (7.9 in) at that distance. The rover has two pairs of black and whitenavigation camerasmounted on the mast to support ground navigation.The cameras have a 45°angle of viewand use visible light to capturestereoscopic 3-D imagery. REMS comprises instruments to measure the Mars environment: humidity, pressure, temperatures, wind speeds, and ultraviolet radiation.It is a meteorological package that includes anultravioletsensor provided by theSpanish Ministry of Education and Science. The investigative team is led by Javier Gómez-Elvira of theSpanish Astrobiology Centerand includes theFinnish Meteorological Instituteas a partner.All sensors are located around three elements: two booms attached to the rover's mast, the Ultraviolet Sensor (UVS) assembly located on the rover top deck, and the Instrument Control Unit (ICU) inside the rover body. REMS provides new clues about the Martian general circulation, micro scale weather systems, local hydrological cycle, destructive potential of UV radiation, and subsurface habitability based on ground-atmosphere interaction. The rover has four pairs of black and white navigation cameras calledhazcams, two pairs in the front and two pairs in the back.They are used for autonomous hazard avoidance during rover drives and for safe positioning of the robotic arm on rocks and regolith.Each camera in a pair is hardlinked to one of two identical main computers for redundancy; only four out of the eight cameras are in use at any one time. The cameras use visible light to capturestereoscopicthree-dimensional (3-D) imagery.The cameras have a 120°field of viewand map the terrain at up to 3 m (9.8 ft) in front of the rover.This imagery safeguards against the rover crashing into unexpected obstacles, and works in tandem with software that allows the rover to make its own safety choices. MAHLI is a camera on the rover's robotic arm, and acquires microscopic images of rock and regolith. MAHLI can taketrue-colorimages at 1600×1200pixelswith a resolution as high as 14.5µmper pixel. MAHLI has an 18.3 to 21.3 mm (0.72 to 0.84 in) focal length and a 33.8–38.5° field of view.MAHLI has both white and ultravioletLight-emitting diode(LED) illumination for imaging in darkness orfluorescenceimaging. MAHLI also has mechanical focusing in a range from infinite to millimeter distances.This system can make some images withfocus stackingprocessing.MAHLI can store either the raw images or do real time lossless predictive or JPEG compression. The calibration target for MAHLI includes color references, a metric bar graphic, a 1909 VDB Lincoln penny, and a stair-step pattern for depth calibration. The APXS instrument irradiates samples withalpha particlesand maps the spectra ofX-raysthat are re-emitted for determining the elemental composition of samples.Curiosity'sAPXS was developed by theCanadian Space Agency(CSA).MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA), the Canadian aerospace company that built theCanadarmandRADARSAT, were responsible for the engineering design and building of the APXS. The APXS science team includes members from theUniversity of Guelph, theUniversity of New Brunswick, theUniversity of Western Ontario,NASA, theUniversity of California, San DiegoandCornell University.The APXS instrument takes advantage ofparticle-induced X-ray emission(PIXE) andX-ray fluorescence, previously exploited by theMars Pathfinderand the twoMars Exploration Rovers. CheMinis the Chemistry and MineralogyX-raypowder diffractionandfluorescenceinstrument.CheMin is one of fourspectrometers. It can identify and quantify the abundance of the minerals on Mars. It was developed by David Blake at NASAAmes Research Centerand theJet Propulsion Laboratory,and won the 2013 NASA Government Invention of the year award.The rover can drill samples from rocks and the resulting fine powder is poured into the instrument via a sample inlet tube on the top of the vehicle. A beam of X-rays is then directed at the powder and the crystal structure of the minerals deflects it at characteristic angles, allowing scientists to identify the minerals being analyzed. On October 17, 2012, at "Rocknest", the firstX-ray diffraction analysisofMartian regolithwas performed. The results revealed the presence of several minerals, includingfeldspar,pyroxenesandolivine, and suggested that the Martian regolith in the sample was similar to the "weatheredbasaltic soils" ofHawaiian volcanoes.The paragonetictephrafrom a Hawaiiancinder conehas been mined to createMartian regolith simulantfor researchers to use since 1998. CheMin eventually found carbonates in the form of crystallinesiderite(FeCO3).  One rock contained over 10 % of the mineral.  Some rocks also were composed of plagioclase with the elements sodium (Na)–, Ca-, and aluminum (Al)–, as well as  Ca- and Mg-bearing silicate mineral pyroxene.   Other minerals found were calcium sulfates, magnesium sulfates, different amounts of iron oxyhydroxides, and an unidentified x-ray amorphous material.  Rover's Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument uses x-ray diffraction to determine sample mineralogy.  The names of the rock formations and drill sites are CA, Canaima; TC, Tapo Caparo; UB, Ubajara; and SQ, Sequoia. V The SAM instrument suite analyzesorganicsand gases from both atmospheric and solid samples. It consists of instruments developed by the NASAGoddard Space Flight Center, the NASAJet Propulsion LaboratorytheLaboratoire atmosphères, milieux, observations spatiales(LATMOS), theLaboratoire Inter-Universitaire des Systèmes Atmosphériques(LISA) (jointly operated by France'sCNRSand Parisian universities), andHoneybee Robotics, along with many additional external partners.The three main instruments are aQuadrupole Mass Spectrometer(QMS), agas chromatograph(GC) and atunable laser spectrometer (TLS). These instruments perform precision measurements ofoxygenandcarbonisotoperatios incarbon dioxide(CO2) andmethane(CH4) in theatmospherein order to distinguish between theirgeochemicalorbiologicalorigin. The Dust Removal Tool (DRT) is a motorized, wire-bristle brush on the turret at the end ofCuriosity'sarm. The DRT was first used on a rock target namedEkwir_1on January 6, 2013.Honeybee Roboticsbuilt the DRT. The role of theRadiation assessment detector(RAD) instrument is to characterize the broad spectrum of radiation environment found inside the spacecraft during the cruise phase and while on Mars. These measurements have never been done before from the inside of a spacecraft in interplanetary space. Its primary purpose is to determine the viability and shielding needs for potential human explorers, as well as to characterize the radiation environment on the surface of Mars, which it started doing immediately after MSL landed in August 2012.Funded by the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate atNASA Headquartersand Germany's Space Agency (DLR), RAD was developed bySouthwest Research Institute(SwRI) and the extraterrestrial physics group atChristian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Germany. The DAN instrument employs aneutron sourceand detector for measuring the quantity and depth ofhydrogenor ice and water at or near the Martian surface.The instrument consists of the detector element (DE) and a 14.1 MeV pulsing neutron generator (PNG). The die-away time of neutrons is measured by the DE after each neutron pulse from the PNG.
DAN was provided by theRussian Federal Space Agencyand funded by Russia. MARDI is fixed to the lower front left corner of the body ofCuriosity. During the descent to the Martian surface, MARDI took color images at 1600×1200 pixels with a 1.3-millisecond exposure time starting at distances of about 3.7 km (2.3 mi) to near 5 m (16 ft) from the ground, at a rate of fourframes per secondfor about two minutes.MARDI has a pixel scale of 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) at 2 km (1.2 mi) to 1.5 mm (0.059 in) at 2 m (6 ft 7 in) and has a 90° circular field of view. MARDI has eight gigabytes of internal buffer memory that is capable of storing over 4,000 raw images. MARDI imaging allowed the mapping of surrounding terrain and the location of landing.JunoCam, built for theJunospacecraft, is based on MARDI. The rover has a 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in) longrobotic armwith a cross-shaped turret holding five devices that can spin through a 350° turning range.The arm makes use of three joints to extend it forward and to stow it again while driving. It has a mass of 30 kg (66 lb) and its diameter, including the tools mounted on it, is about 60 cm (24 in).It was designed, built, and tested byMDA US Systems, building upon their prior robotic arm work on theMars Surveyor 2001 Lander, thePhoenixlander, and the twoMars Exploration Rovers,SpiritandOpportunity. Two of the five devices arein-situor contact instruments known as theX-ray spectrometer(APXS), and theMars Hand Lens Imager(MAHLI camera). The remaining three are associated with sample acquisition and sample preparation functions: apercussion drill; a brush; and mechanisms for scooping, sieving, and portioning samples of powdered rock and regolith.The diameter of the hole in a rock after drilling is 1.6 cm (0.63 in) and up to 5 cm (2.0 in) deep.The drill carries two spare bits.The rover's arm and turret system can place the APXS and MAHLI on their respective targets, and also obtain powdered sample from rock interiors, and deliver them to theSAMandCheMinanalyzers inside the rover. Since early 2015 the percussive mechanism in the drill that helps chisel into rock has had an intermittent electrical short.On December 1, 2016, the motor inside the drill caused a malfunction that prevented the rover from moving its robotic arm and driving to another location.The fault was isolated to the drill feed brake,and internal debris is suspected of causing the problem.By December 9, 2016, driving and robotic arm operations were cleared to continue, but drilling remained suspended indefinitely.TheCuriosityteam continued to perform diagnostics and testing on the drill mechanism throughout 2017,and resumed drilling operations on May 22, 2018. Live video showing the first footage from the surface of Mars was available atNASA TV, during the late hours of August 6, 2012, PDT, including interviews with the mission team. The NASA website momentarily became unavailable from the overwhelming number of people visiting it,and a 13-minute NASA excerpt of the landings on its YouTube channel was halted an hour after the landing by an automatedcopyrighttakedown notice fromScripps Local News, which prevented access for several hours.Around 1,000 people gathered in New York City'sTimes Square, to watch NASA's live broadcast ofCuriosity'slanding, as footage was being shown on the giant screen.Bobak Ferdowsi, Flight Director for the landing, became anInternet memeand attained Twitter celebrity status, with 45,000 new followers subscribing to his Twitter account, due to hisMohawk hairstylewith yellow stars that he wore during the televised broadcast. On August 13, 2012, U.S. PresidentBarack Obama, calling from aboardAir Force Oneto congratulate theCuriosityteam, said, "You guys are examples of American know-how and ingenuity. It's really an amazing accomplishment".(Video (07:20)ArchivedMay 21, 2013, at theWayback Machine) Scientists at theGetty Conservation Institutein Los Angeles, California, viewed the CheMin instrument aboardCuriosityas a potentially valuable means to examine ancient works of art without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. CheMin directs a beam ofX-raysat particles as small as 400 μm (0.016 in)and reads theradiationscatteredback to determine the composition of the artifact in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version named theX-Duetto. Fitting into a fewbriefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museumantiquesand the Roman ruins ofHerculaneum, Italy. Prior to the landing, NASA andMicrosoftreleasedMars Rover Landing, a free downloadable game onXbox Livethat usesKinectto capture body motions, which allows users to simulate the landing sequence. NASA gave the general public the opportunity from 2009 until 2011 to submit their names to be sent to Mars. More than 1.2 million people from the international community participated, and their names were etched intosiliconusing an electron-beam machine used for fabricating micro devices atJPL, and this plaque is now installed on the deck ofCuriosity.In keeping with a 40-year tradition, a plaque with the signatures of President Barack Obama andVice President Joe Bidenwas also installed. Elsewhere on the rover is theautographof Clara Ma, the 12-year-old girl fromKansaswho gaveCuriosityits name in an essay contest, writing in part that "curiosity is the passion that drives us through our everyday lives". On August 6, 2013,Curiosityaudibly played "Happy Birthday to You" in honor of the one Earth year mark of its Martian landing, the first time for a song to be played on another planet. This was also the first time music was transmitted between two planets. On June 24, 2014,Curiositycompleted aMartian year– 687 Earth days – after finding that Mars once hadenvironmental conditions favorable for microbial life.Curiosityserved as the basis for the design of thePerseverance roverfor theMars 2020 rover mission. Some spare parts from the build and ground test ofCuriosityare being used in the new vehicle, but it will carry a different instrument payload. In 2014, project chief engineer wrote a book detailing the development of the Curiosity rover. "Mars Rover Curiosity: An Inside Account from Curiosity's Chief Engineer," is a firsthand account of the development and landing of the Curiosity Rover. On August 5, 2017, NASA celebrated the fifth anniversary of theCuriosityrover mission landing, and related exploratory accomplishments, on the planetMars.(Videos:Curiosity'sFirst Five Years (02:07);Curiosity'sPOV: Five Years Driving (05:49);Curiosity'sDiscoveries About Gale Crater (02:54)) As reported in 2018, drill samples taken in 2015 uncovered organic molecules ofbenzeneandpropanein 3 billion year old rock samples in Gale. In popular culture, the launch ofCuriosityis referenced in the music video forHarry Styles' 2023 song, "Satellite". In March 2024 it was published that Curiosity discovered long chainalkaneswith up to 12 consecutive carbon atoms, inmudstonein Gale crater. The origin of these molecules is unknown. They could be derived from either abiotic or biological sources.

Perseveranceis aNASAroverthat has been exploringMarssince February 18, 2021,as part of theMars 2020mission. Built and managed by theJet Propulsion Laboratory, it was launched on July 30, 2020,fromCape Canaveralaboard anAtlas Vrocket and landed inJezero Crater, a site chosen for its ancientriver deltathat may preserve evidence of pastmicrobial life. The rover's main goals are to search for signs of ancient life, study the planet's geology and climate, and collect rock andregolithsamples for possible return to Earth by a future mission.Perseverancealso tests technologies intended to support laterhuman exploration, including an experiment that successfully produced oxygen from the thincarbon-dioxideatmosphere. Perseverancecarries seven primary scientific instruments, 19 cameras, and two microphones.It also deployed the experimental helicopterIngenuity, which in April 2021 performed the first powered and controlled flight on another planet.Originally intended for up to five flights,Ingenuitycompleted dozens of sorties before being retired in 2024. Powered by aradioisotope thermoelectric generator,Perseverancehas an expected mission duration of over a decade.It has provided high-resolution panoramas, drilled and cached samples for later retrieval, and identified rocks which may have been habitable for ancient microbial life in Jezero Crater. As of October 3, 2025, the rover has been active on Mars for 1,642sols(1,688 Earth days). Despite the high-profile success of theCuriosityroverlanding in August 2012, NASA's Mars Exploration Program was in a state of uncertainty in the early 2010s. Budget cuts forced NASA to pull out of a planned collaboration with theEuropean Space Agencywhich included a rover mission.By the summer of 2012, a program that had been launching a mission to Mars every two years suddenly found itself with no missions approved after 2013. In 2011, thePlanetary Science Decadal Survey, a report from theNational Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicinecontaining an influential set of recommendations made by the planetary science community, stated that the top priority of NASA's planetary exploration program in the decade between 2013 and 2022 should be to begin aNASA-ESA Mars Sample Returncampaign, a four-mission project to cache, retrieve, launch, and safely return samples of the Martian surface to Earth. The report stated that NASA should invest in a sample-caching rover as the first step in this effort, with the goal of keeping costs under US$2.5 billion. After the success of theCuriosityrover and in response to the recommendations of the decadal survey,NASAannounced its intent to launch a new Mars rover mission by 2020 at theAmerican Geophysical Unionconference in December 2012. Though initially hesitant to commit to an ambitious sample-caching capability (and subsequent follow-on missions), a NASA-convened science definition team for the Mars 2020 project released a report in July 2013 that the mission should "select and store a compelling suite of samples in a returnable cache." ThePerseverancerover has four main science objectivesthat support theMars Exploration Program's science goals: In the first science campaign, dubbed "Crater Floor",Perseveranceperformed an arching drive southward from its landing site to the Séítah unit to perform a "toe dip" into the unit to collect remote-sensing measurements of geologic targets. After that it returned to the Crater Floor Fractured Rough to collect the first core sample there. Passing by the Octavia E. Butler landing site concluded the first science campaign. The second campaign, "Fan Front", included several months of travel towards the "Three Forks" wherePerseveranceaccessed geologic locations at the base of the ancient delta of Neretva river, as well as ascending the delta by driving up a valley wall to the northwest. The third and fourth campaigns were called "Upper Fan", and "Margin Unit", and the fifth campaign, "Northern Rim", in progress as of December 2024, is exploring "the northern part of the southwestern section of Jezero's rim" to study "rocks from deep down inside Mars that were thrown upward to form the crater rim" after the impact 3.9 billion years ago that formed Jezero Crater. The scientific results, as of 2025, are as follows. According to NASA, the mission has made "discoveries about the volcanic history, habitability, and role of water in Jezero Crater."Specifically, they reported that instead of all the rocks in Jezero crater being sedimentary, being "transported into the crater by wind or water," "several types ofigneousrock" were discovered, which "showed evidence of interaction with water."Additionally, At a rock named "Wildcat Ridge" located within Jezero's well-preserved sedimentary fan deposit, Perseverance found evidence for an ancient lake environment. Not only were these sediments likely deposited in a standing body of water, but they also continued to interact with water long after they were formed. The environments recorded within the rocks at Wildcat Ridge would have been habitable for ancient microbial life, and this type of rock is ideal for preserving possible signs of ancient life. They also found that "sediments entering Jezero's lake were deposited in a delta" and  "evidence for late-stage, high-energy flooding that carried large boulders into the crater."The MOXIE experiment produced 122 grams of oxygen from carbon dioxide.The microphone studies showed that the speed of sound is slower and the volumes of sounds transmitted through the atmosphere is lower, than on Earth.PIXL found that the Seitah formation and a rock at "Otis Peak" contained olivine, phosphates, sulfates, clays, carbonate minerals, silicate minerals, "augite pyroxene, feldspathic mesostasis, various Fe,Cr,Ti-spinels, and merrillite", perchlorate, feldspar, magnesite, siderite, oxides, as well as minerals with composition including magnesium, iron, chlorine, and sodium.RIMFAX revealed findings "consistent with a subsurface dominated by solid rock and mafic material"and that "the crater floor experienced a period of erosion before the deposition of the overlying delta strata. The regularity and horizontality of the basal delta sediments observed in the radar cross sections indicate that they were deposited in a low-energy lake environment." ThePerseverancedesign evolved from its predecessor, theCuriosityrover. The two rovers share a similar body plan, landing system, cruise stage, and power system, but the design was improved in several ways forPerseverance. Engineers designed the rover wheels to be more robust thanCuriosity'swheels, which hadsustained some damage.Perseverancehas thicker, more durablealuminumwheels, with reduced width and a greater diameter, 52.5 cm (20.7 in), thanCuriosity's50 cm (20 in) wheels.The aluminum wheels are covered with cleats for traction and curvedtitaniumspokes for springy support.Theheat shieldfor the rover was made out ofphenolic-impregnated carbon ablator(PICA), to allow it to withstand up to 2,400 °F (1,320 °C) of heat.LikeCuriosity, the rover includes arobotic arm, althoughPerseverance's arm is longer and stronger, measuring 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in). The arm hosts an elaboraterock-coringand sampling mechanism to store geologic samples from the Martian surface insterilecaching tubes.There is also a secondary arm hidden below the rover that helps store the chalk-sized samples. This arm is known as the Sample Handling Assembly (SHA), and is responsible for moving the soil samples to various stations within the Adaptive Caching Assembly (ACA) on the underside of the rover. These stations include volume assessment(measuring the length of sample), imaging, seal dispensing, and hermetic seal station, among others.Owing to the small space in which the SHA must operate, as well as load requirements during sealing activities, the Sample Caching System "is the most complicated, most sophisticated mechanism that we have ever built, tested and readied for spaceflight." The combination of larger instruments, new sampling and caching system, and modified wheels makesPerseveranceheavier, weighing 1,025 kg (2,260 lb) compared toCuriosityat 899 kg (1,982 lb)—a 14% increase. The rover'smulti-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator(MMRTG) has a mass of 45 kg (99 lb) and uses 4.8 kg (11 lb) ofplutonium-238oxideas its power source. The radioactive decay of plutonium-238, which has ahalf-lifeof 87.7 years, gives off heat which isconverted to electricity—approximately 110wattsat launch.This will decrease over time as its power source decays.The MMRTG charges twolithium-ion rechargeable batterieswhich power the rover's activities, and must be recharged periodically. Unlikesolar panels, the MMRTG provides engineers with significant flexibility in operating the rover's instruments even at night, duringdust storms, and through winter. The rover's computer uses the BAE SystemsRAD750radiation-hardenedsingle board computer based on a ruggedizedPowerPC G3 microprocessor (PowerPC 750). The computer contains 128 megabytes of volatileDRAM, and runs at 133 MHz. The flight software runs on theVxWorksoperating system, is written inCand is able to access 4 gigabytes ofNAND non-volatile memoryon a separate card.Perseverancerelies on three antennas fortelemetry, all of which are relayed through craft currently in orbit around Mars. The primaryUHFantenna can send data from the rover at a maximum rate of two megabits per second.Two slowerX-bandantennas provide communications redundancy. NASA considered nearly 60 proposalsfor rover instrumentation. On July 31, 2014, NASA announced the seven instruments that would make up the payload for the rover: There are additional cameras and two audio microphones (the first working microphones on Mars), that will be used for engineering support during landing,driving, and collecting samples.For a full look atPerseverance's components seeLearn About the Rover. TheIngenuityhelicopter, powered by solar-charged batteries, was sent to Mars in the same bundle withPerseverance. With a mass of 1.8 kg (4.0 lb), the helicopter demonstrated the reality of flight in the rarefiedMartian atmosphereand the potential usefulness of aerial scouting for rover missions. It carried two cameras but no scientific instrumentsand communicated with Earth via a base station onboardPerseverance.Its pre-launch experimental test plan was three flights in 45 days, but it far exceeded expectations and made72 flightsin nearly three years. After its first few flights, it made incrementally more ambitious ones, several of which were recorded byPerseverance's cameras. The first flight was April 19, 2021, at 07:15 UTC, with confirmation from data reception at 10:15 UTC.It was the first powered flight by any aircraft on another planet.On January 18, 2024 (UTC), it made its72nd and final flight, suffering the loss of a rotor blade (imaged, byPerseverance, lying on the sand roughly 15 m (49 ft) distant from the upright body ofIngenuity), causing NASA to retire it. Associate Administrator ofNASA's Science Mission DirectorateThomas Zurbuchenselected the namePerseverancefollowing a nationwideK-12student "name the rover" contest that attracted more than 28,000 proposals. Aseventh-gradestudent, Alexander Mather fromLake Braddock Secondary SchoolinBurke, Virginia, submitted the winning entry at theJet Propulsion Laboratory. In addition to the honor of naming the rover, Mather and his family were invited to NASA'sKennedy Space Centerto watch the rover's July 2020 launch fromCape Canaveral Air Force Station(CCAFS) inFlorida.He was also joined at the launch by 11th grade student Vaneeza Rupani fromTuscaloosa County High SchoolinNorthport, Alabama, who named theIngenuityhelicopter that would fly withPerseverance. Mather wrote in his winning essay: Curiosity.InSight.Spirit.Opportunity. If you think about it, all of these names of past Mars rovers are qualities we possess as humans. We are always curious, and seek opportunity. We have the spirit and insight to explore the Moon, Mars, and beyond. But, if rovers are to be the qualities of us as a race, we missed the most important thing: Perseverance. We as humans evolved as creatures who could learn to adapt to any situation, no matter how harsh. We are a species of explorers, and we will meet many setbacks on the way to Mars. However, we can persevere. We, not as a nation but as humans, will not give up. The human race will always persevere into the future. JPL built a copy of thePerseverance; a twin rover used for testing and problem solving,OPTIMISM(Operational Perseverance Twin for Integration of Mechanisms and Instruments Sent to Mars), a vehicle system test bed (VSTB). It is housed at the JPLMars Yardand is used to test operational procedures and to aid in problem solving should any issues arise withPerseverance. ThePerseverancerover lifted off successfully on July 30, 2020, at 11:50:00 UTC aboard aUnited Launch AllianceAtlas Vlaunch vehiclefromSpace Launch Complex 41, atCape Canaveral Air Force Station(CCAFS) inFlorida. The rover took 29 weeks to travel to Mars and made its landing inJezero Crateron February 18, 2021, to begin its science phase. After May 17, 2022, the rover will move uphill and examine rocks on the surface for evidence of past life onMars. On its return downhill, it will collect sample rocks to be retrieved and examined by future expeditions. The successful landing ofPerseveranceinJezero Craterwas announced at 20:55 UTC on February 18, 2021,the signal from Mars taking 11 minutes to arrive at Earth. The rover touched down at18°26′41″N77°27′03″E﻿ / ﻿18.4446°N 77.4509°E﻿ /18.4446; 77.4509,roughly 1 km (0.62 mi) southeast of the center of its 7.7 km × 6.6 km (4.8 mi × 4.1 mi)wide landing ellipse. It came down pointed almost directly to the southeast,with the RTG on the back of the vehicle pointing northwest. The descent stage ("sky crane"), parachute and heat shield all came to rest within 1.5 km of the rover (see satellite image). Having come within five meters (16 ft) of its target,[which?]the landing was more accurate than any previous Mars landing; a feat enabled by the experience gained fromCuriosity's landing and the use of new steering technology. One such new technology is Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN), a technique in which the rover compares images of the surface taken during its descent with reference maps, allowing it to make last minute adjustments to its course. The rover also uses the images to select a safe landing site at the last minute, allowing it to land in relatively unhazardous terrain. This enables it to land much closer to its science objectives than previous missions, which all had to use a landing ellipse devoid of hazards. The landing occurred in the late afternoon, with the first images taken at 15:53:58 on themission clock(local mean solar time).The landing took place shortly after Mars passed through itsnorthern vernal equinox(Ls= 5.2°), at the start of the astronomical spring, the equivalent of the end of March on Earth. The parachute descent of thePerseverancerover was photographed by theHiRISEhigh-resolution camera on theMars Reconnaissance Orbiter(MRO). Jezero Crater is a paleolake basin.It was selected as the landing site for this mission in part because paleolake basins tend to containperchlorates.AstrobiologistDr. Kennda Lynch'swork in analog environments on Earth suggests that the composition of the crater, including the bottomset deposits accumulated from three different sources in the area, is a likely place to discover evidence of perchlorate-reducing microbes, if such bacteria are living or were formerly living on Mars. A few days after landing,Perseverancereleased the first audio recorded on the surface of Mars, capturing the sound of Martianwind. During its travels on Mars, NASA scientists had observed around Sol 341 (February 4, 2022) that a small rock had dropped into one of its wheels while the rover was studying the Máaz rock formation. The rock was visible from one of the hazard avoidance cameras, and was determined not to be harmful to the rover's mission. The rock has since stayed onPerseverance's wheel for around 427 sols (439 days) as the rover traveled over 6 miles (9.7 km) on the martian surface. NASA deemed thatPerseverancehad adopted apet rockfor its journey.Later, by May 2024, the rover picked up another pet rock named "Dwayne". It is planned forPerseveranceto visit the bottom and upper parts of the 3.4 to 3.8 billion-year-oldNeretva Vallisdelta, the smooth and etched parts of the Jezero Crater floor deposits interpreted as volcanic ash or aeolian airfall deposits, emplaced before the formation of the delta; the ancient shoreline covered withTransverse Aeolian Ridges(dunes) and mass wasting deposits, and finally, it is planned to climb onto the Jezero Crater rim. In its progressive commissioning and tests,Perseverancemade its first test drive on Mars on March 4, 2021. NASA released photographs of the rover's first wheel tracks on the Martian soil. In support of theNASA-ESA Mars Sample Return, rock,regolith(Martian soil), and atmosphere samples are being cached byPerseverance. As of July 2025,[update]33 out of 43 sample tubes have been filled,including 8 igneous rock samples, 13 sedimentary rock sample tubes, 3 Igneous/Impactiterock sample tubes, aSerpentiniterock sample tube, aSilica-cementedcarbonate rocksample tube,two regolith sample tubes, an atmosphere sample tube,and three witness tubes.Before launch, 5 of the 43 tubes were designated "witness tubes" and filled with materials that would capture particulates in the ambient environment of Mars. Out of 43 tubes, 3 witness sample tubes will not be returned to Earth and will remain on rover as the sample canister will only have 30 tube slots. Further, 10 of the 43 tubes are left as backups at the Three Forks Sample Depot. In July 2024,Perseverancediscovered "leopard spots" on a reddish rock nicknamed "Cheyava Falls" in Mars'Jezero Crater, that has some indications it may have hosted microbial life billions of years ago, but further research is needed. NASA plans to invest roughly US$2.75 billion in the project over 11 years, including US$2.2 billion for the development and building of the hardware, US$243 million for launch services, and US$291 million for 2.5 years of mission operations. Adjusted for inflation,Perseveranceis NASA's sixth-most expensive robotic planetary mission, though it is cheaper than its predecessor,Curiosity.Perseverancebenefited from spare hardware and "build-to print" designs from theCuriositymission, which helped reduce development costs and saved "probably tens of millions, if not 100 million dollars" according to Mars 2020 Deputy Chief Engineer Keith Comeaux. NASA's "Send Your Name to Mars" campaign invited people from around the world to submit their names to travel aboard the agency's next rover to Mars. 10,932,295 names were submitted. The names were etched by an electron beam onto three fingernail-sizedsiliconchips, along with the essays of the 155 finalists in NASA's "Name the Rover" contest. The three chips share space on an anodized plate with a laser engraved graphic representing Earth, Mars, and the Sun. The rays emanating from the Sun contain the phrase "Explore As One" written inMorse code.The plate was then mounted on the rover on March 26, 2020. Part ofPerseverance's cargo is ageocachingtrackable item viewable with the SHERLOC's WATSON camera. In 2016, NASA SHERLOC co-investigator Dr. Marc Fries — with help from his son Wyatt — was inspired by Geocaching's 2008 placement of a cache on the International Space Station to set out and try something similar with the rover mission. After floating the idea around mission management, it eventually reached NASA scientist Francis McCubbin, who would join the SHERLOC instrument team as a collaborator to move the project forward. The Geocaching inclusion was scaled-down to a trackable item that players could search for from NASA camera views and then log on to the site.In a manner similar to the "Send Your Name to Mars" campaign, the geocaching trackable code was carefully printed on a one-inch, polycarbonate glass disk serving as part of the rover's calibration target. It will serve as an optical target for the WATSON imager and a spectroscopic standard for the SHERLOC instrument. The disk is made of a prototype astronaut helmet visor material that will be tested for its potential use in crewed missions to Mars. Designs were approved by the mission leads at NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL), NASA Public Affairs, and NASA HQ, in addition to Groundspeak Geocaching HQ. Perseverancelaunched during theCOVID-19 pandemic, which began to affect the mission planning in March 2020. To show appreciation for healthcare workers who helped during the pandemic, an 8 cm × 13 cm (3.1 in × 5.1 in) plate with astaff-and-serpent symbol(aGreeksymbol of medicine) was placed on the rover. The project manager, Matt Wallace, said he hoped that future generations going to Mars would be able to appreciate healthcare workers during 2020. One of the external plates ofPerseveranceincludes a simplified representation of all previous NASA Martian rovers,Sojourner,Spirit,Opportunity,Curiosity, as well asPerseveranceandIngenuity, similar to the trend of automobile window decals used to show a family's makeup. The orange-and-white parachute used to land the rover on Mars contained a coded message that was deciphered by Twitter users. NASA's systems engineer Ian Clark used binary code to hide the message "dare mighty things" in the parachute color pattern. The 21-meter-wide (70 ft) parachute consisted of 80 strips of fabric that form a hemisphere-shape canopy, and each strip consisted of four pieces. Dr. Clark thus had 320 pieces with which to encode the message. He also included theGPScoordinates for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's headquarters inPasadena, California(34°11'58" N 118°10'31" W). Clark said that only six people knew about the message before landing. The code was deciphered a few hours after the image was presented byPerseverance's team. "Dare mighty things" is a quote attributed to U.S. presidentTheodore Rooseveltand is the unofficial motto of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.It adorns many of theJPL center'swalls. In December 2021, the NASA team announced a program to students who haveperseveredwith academic challenges. Those nominated will be rewarded with a personal message beamed back from Mars by thePerseverancerover. March 5, 2024:NASA released images of transits of the moonDeimos, the moonPhobosand the planet Mercury as viewed by thePerseverancerover on the planet Mars.

TheInterior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport(InSight)mission was aroboticlanderdesigned to study the deep interior of the planetMars.It was manufactured byLockheed Martin Space, was managed by NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL),and two of its three scientific instruments were built by European agencies.InSightconfirmed "marsquakes" on the planet and thus a still active interior. The mission launched on 5 May 2018 at 11:05:01UTCaboard anAtlas V-401launch vehicleand successfully landedatElysium Planitiaon Mars on 26 November 2018 at 19:52:59 UTC.InSightwas active on Mars for 1440sols(1480days; 4 years, 19 days). InSight'sobjectives were to place aseismometer, calledSeismic Experiment for Interior Structure(SEIS), on the surface of Mars to measure seismic activity and provide accurate 3D models of the planet's interior; and measure internalheat transferusing a heat probe calledHP3to study Mars's early geological evolution.This was intended to provide a new understanding of how the Solar System'sterrestrial planets–Mercury,Venus,Earth,Mars– and Earth'sMoonformed and evolved. The lander was originally planned for launch in March 2016.An instrument problem delayed the launch beyond the 2016launch window. NASA officials rescheduled theInSightlaunch to May 2018and during the wait the instrument was repaired. This increased the total cost from US$675 million to US$830 million. InSightsuccessfully landed on Mars on 26 November 2018. Due to excessive dust on its solar panels preventing it from recharging, NASA putInSightin low-power mode for detecting seismic events in July 2022 and continued monitoring the lander through the operational period ending in December 2022.On 20 December 2022, NASA announced that the InSight lander had lost communications with Earth on 15 December 2022, with the end of the mission being declared on 21 December 2022. InSightwas initially known asGEMS(Geophysical Monitoring Station), but its name was changed in early 2012 following a request by NASA.Out of 28 proposals from 2010,it was one of the threeDiscovery Programfinalists receiving $3 million in May 2011 to develop a detailed concept study.In August 2012,InSightwas selected for development and launch.Managed by NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL) with participation from scientists from several countries, the mission was cost-capped at US$425 million, not including launch vehicle funding. By reusing the landing system designed for the MarsPhoenixlander, which successfully landed on Mars in 2008, mission costs and risks were reduced. Lockheed Martin began construction of the lander on 19 May 2014,with general testing starting on 27 May 2015. A persistent vacuum leak in theCNES-supplied seismometer known as theSeismic Experiment for Interior Structure(SEIS) led NASA to postpone the planned launch in March 2016 to May 2018. WhenInSightwas delayed, the rest of the spacecraft was returned to Lockheed Martin's factory inColoradofor storage, and the Atlas V launch vehicle intended to launch the spacecraft was reassigned to theWorldView-4mission. On 9 March 2016, NASA officials announced thatInSightwould be delayed until the 2018 launch window at an estimated cost of US$150 million.The spacecraft was rescheduled to launch on 5 May 2018 for a Mars landing on 26 November 2018 at 20:00 UTC. The flight plan remained unchanged with launch using an Atlas V launch vehicle fromVandenberg Space Force Basein California.NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory was tasked with redesigning and building a new vacuum enclosure for the SEIS instrument, while CNES conducted instrument integration and testing. On 22 November 2017,InSightcompleted testing in a thermal vacuum, also known as TVAC testing, where the spacecraft is put in simulated space conditions with reduced pressure and various thermal loads.On 23 January 2018, after a long storage, its solar panels were once again deployed and tested, and a second silicon chip containing 1.6 million names from the public was added to the lander. The InSight lander, powered by solar panels and batteries, relies on periodic wind gusts called "cleaning events" to reduce dust accumulation on the panels.  Elysium Planitia, the landing site of InSight, has experienced fewer cleaning events than needed to keep the science operations powered.  In February 2021, at the start of the Martian winter, InSight's solar cells were producing 27% of capacity due to a thick covering of dust on the panels. At that time NASA began the process of putting the lander into hibernation mode, shutting down data-gathering instruments on a schedule to conserve enough power to keep the lander electronics warm through the Martian winter.  NASA had hoped that weather conditions would improve and allow InSight to store enough energy to come out of hibernation in July 2021.In May 2021, some generation capacity was restored by using the arm to position sand so it could blow onto the solar panels and scour them clean. NASA determined in May 2022 that there was too much dust on the panels to continue the mission. InSight was generating only one-tenth of the power from the sunlight than it did upon arrival.They put the lander in a low-power mode in July 2022 to continue monitoring for seismic events. NASA continued to monitorInSightuntil the end of 2022, when the spacecraft missed two consecutive communication attempts. BothVikingspacecraft carried seismometers mounted on their landers, and in 1976 vibrations were picked up from various lander operations and from the wind.However, theViking 1lander's seismometer did not deploy properly and did not unlock; the locked seismometer could not operate. TheViking 2seismometer unlocked; it operated and returned data to Earth.One problem was accounting for other data. On Sol 80, theViking 2seismometer detected an event.No wind data were recorded at the same time, so it was not possible to determine whether the data indicated a seismic event or wind gust. Other lacking data would have been useful to rule out other sources of vibrations.Two other problems were the location of the lander and that a certain level of wind on Mars caused a loss of sensitivity for theViking 2seismometer.To overcome these and other issues, InSight had many other sensors, was placed directly on the surface, and also had a windshield. Despite the difficulties, theViking 2seismometer readings were used to estimate a Martian geologicalcrustthickness between 14 and 18 km (8.7 and 11.2 mi) at theViking 2lander site.TheViking 2seismometer did detect vibrations from Mars winds complementing the meteorology results.There was the aforementioned candidate for a possiblemarsquake, but it was not particularly definitive. The wind data did prove useful in its own right, and despite the limitations of the data, widespread and large marsquakes were not detected. Seismometerswere also left on the Moon, starting withApollo 11in 1969, and also byApollo 12,14,15and16missions and provided many insights intolunar seismology, including the discovery ofmoonquakes.The Apollo seismic network, which was operated until 1977, detected at least 28 moonquakes up to 5.5 on theRichter scale. One of the aspects of the InSight mission was to compare the Earth, Moon, and Mars seismic data. Well, seismic investigation is really the heart of this mission. Seismology is the method that we've used to gain almost everything we know, all the basic information about the interior of the Earth, and we also used it back during the Apollo era to understand and to measure sort of the properties of the inside of the moon. And so, we want to apply the same techniques but use the waves that are generated by Mars quakes, by meteorite impacts to probe deep into the interior of Mars all the way down to its core. —Gravity Assist: Mars and InSightwith Bruce Banerdt (3 May 2018) On 4 May 2022, a largemarsquake, estimated at magnitude 5, was detected by theseismometeron the InSight lander. On 25 October 2023, scientists, helped by information from InSight, reported that the planet Mars has aradioactivemagma oceanunder its crust. Radio Doppler measurements were taken withVikingand twenty years later withMars Pathfinder, and in each case theaxis of rotationof Mars was estimated. By combining this data, the core size was constrained, because the change in axis of rotation over 20 years allowed aprecessionrate and from that the planet'smoment of inertiato be estimated.InSight'smeasurements of crust thickness, mantle viscosity, core radius and density, and seismic activity were planned to result in a three- to tenfold increase in accuracy compared to previous data. TheInSightmission placed a single stationary lander on Mars to study its deep interior and address a fundamental issue of planetary and Solar System science: understanding the processes that shaped therocky planetsof the inner Solar System (including Earth) more than four billion years ago. InSight'sprimary objective was to study the earliest evolutionary processes that shaped Mars. By studying the size, thickness, density and overall structure of Mars'score,mantleandcrust, as well as the rate at which heat escapes from the planet's interior,InSightwas intended to provide a glimpse into theevolutionary processesof all of the rocky planets in the inner Solar System.The rocky inner planets share a common ancestry that begins withaccretion. As the body increases in size, its interior heats up and evolves to become aterrestrial planet, containing a core, mantle and crust.Despite this common ancestry, each of the terrestrial planets is later shaped and molded through the poorly understood process ofdifferentiation.InSightmission's goal was to improve the understanding of this process and, by extension, terrestrial evolution, by measuring the planetary building blocks shaped by this differentiation: a terrestrial planet's core, mantle and crust. The mission was designed determine if there is anyseismic activity, measure the rate of heat flow from the interior, estimate the size of Mars'scoreand establish whether the core is liquid or solid.This data would be the first of its kind for Mars.It was also expected that frequentmeteor airbursts(10–200 detectable events per year forInSight) would provide additional seismo-acoustic signals to probe the interior of Mars.The mission's secondary objective was to conduct an in-depth study ofgeophysics,tectonic activityand the effect ofmeteorite impactson Mars, which could provide knowledge about such processes on Earth. Measurements of crust thickness, mantle viscosity, core radius and density, and seismic activity should result in a three- to tenfold increase in accuracy compared to current data.This was the first time a robotic lander dug this deep into the Martian crust. In terms of fundamental processes shaping planetary formation, it is thought that Mars contains the most in-depth and accurate historical record, because it is big enough to have undergone the earliestaccretionand internal heating processes that shaped the terrestrial planets, but small enough to have retained signs of those processes. The science phase is expected to last for two years. In March 2021, NASA reported, based on measurements of over 500Marsquakesby theInSightlander on the planet Mars, that the core of Mars is between 1,810 and 1,860 km (1,120 and 1,160 mi), about half the size of thecoreofEarth, and significantly smaller than thought earlier, suggesting a core of lighterelements. In August 2024, a reservoir of liquid water was discovered on Mars – deep in the rocky outer crust of the planet. The findings came from a new analysis of data from Nasa's Mars Insight Lander, which recorded four years' of vibrations – Mars quakes – from deep inside the Red Planet. The analysis revealed reservoirs of water at depths of about six to 12 miles (10 to 20km) in the Martian crust. As per estimates, there may be enough water, trapped in tiny cracks and pores of rock in the middle of the Martian crust, to fill oceans on the planet's surface. The groundwater would likely cover the entirety of Mars to a depth of 1 mile (1.6 kilometers), the study found. The mission further developed a design based on the 2008PhoenixMars lander.BecauseInSightwas powered bysolar panels, it landed near the equator to enable maximum power for a projected lifetime of two years (1Martian year).The mission included two relay microsatellites calledMars Cube One(MarCO) that launched withInSightbut were flying in formation withInSightto Mars. Three major aspects to the InSight spacecraft were thecruise stage, theentry, descent, and landing system, and thelander. Power is generated by two roundsolar panels, each 2.15 m (7.1 ft) in diameter when unfurled, and consisting of SolAeroZTJ triple-junction solar cellsmade ofInGaP/InGaAs/Gearranged onOrbital ATKUltraFlex arrays. After touchdown on the Martian surface, the arrays are deployed by opening like afolding fan. InSight'slanderpayloadhad a total mass of 50 kg (110 lb), including science instruments and support systems such as the Auxiliary Payload Sensor Suite, cameras, the instrument deployment system, and alaser retroreflector. InSightperformed three major experiments using SEIS, HP3and RISE.SEIS is a very sensitive seismometer, measuring vibrations; HP3involves a burrowing probe to measure the thermal properties of the subsurface.RISE uses the radio communication equipment on the lander and on Earth to measure the overall movement of planet Mars that could reveal the size and density of its core. The two relay 6U cubesats were part of the overall InSight program, and were launched at the same time as the lander but they were attached to the centaur upper stage (InSight's second stage in the launch). They were ejected from the stage after launch and coasted to Mars independent of the main InSight cruise stage with the lander. JPL also built a full-scale engineering model, namedForeSight. This was used to practice instrument deployment, trial new ways to deploy the HP3instrument, and test methods to reduce seismometer noise. With the mission now ended, the testbed is being scrapped and its parts will be offered to other teams such as theMars Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL)for the Mars Sample Return campaign at JPL to be repurposed for their own needs. Anything that is not needed will go into storage. As of now, no attempt is planned to be undertaken to restore ForeSight or to send it to a museum. On 28 February 2018,InSightwas shipped viaC-17 cargo aircraftfrom the Lockheed Martin Space building inDenvertoVandenberg Air Force BaseinCaliforniain order to be integrated to the launch vehicle.The lander was launched on 5 May 2018 and arrived on Mars at approximately 19:54 UTC on 26 November 2018. The spacecraft was launched on 5 May 2018 at 11:05 UTC on an Atlas V 401 launch vehicle (AV-078) fromVandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3-East.This was the first Americaninterplanetary missionto launch from California. The launch was managed by NASA'sLaunch Services Program.InSightwas originally scheduled for launch on 4 March 2016 on anAtlas V401 (4 meter fairing/zero (0)solid rocket boosters/single (1) engineCentaur) fromVandenberg Air Force Basein California, U.S.,but was called off in December 2015 due to a vacuum leak on the SEIS instrument.The rescheduled launch window ran from 5 May to 8 June 2018. Major components of the launch vehicle include: The journey to Mars took 6.5 months across 484 million km (301 million mi) for a touchdown on 26 November.After a successful landing, a three-month-long deployment phase commenced as part of its two-year (a little more than oneMartian year) prime mission. After its launch from Earth on 5 May in 2018, it coasted through interplanetary space for 6.5 months traveling across 484 million km (301 million mi) for a touchdown on 26 November in that year. InSight cruise stage departed Earth at a speed of 10,000 kilometres per hour (6,200 mph).The MarCo probes were ejected from the 2nd stage Centaur booster and traveled to Mars independent of the InSight cruise stage, but they were all launched together.[citation needed] During the cruise to Mars, the InSight cruise stage made several course adjustments, and the first of these (TCM-1) took place on 22 May 2018.The cruise stage that carries the lander includes solar panels, antenna, star trackers,Sun sensor,inertial measurement unitamong its technologies.The thrusters are actually on theInSightlander itself, but there are cutouts in the shell so the relevant rockets can vent into space. The final course correction was 25 November 2018, the day before its touch down.A few hours before making contact with the Martian atmosphere, the cruise stage was jettisoned, on 26 November 2018. On 26 November 2018, at approximately 19:53 UTC, mission controllers received a signal via theMars Cube One(MarCO) satellites that the spacecraft had successfully touched downatElysium Planitia.After landing, the mission took three months to deploy and commission the geophysical science instruments.It  then began its mission of observing Mars, which was planned to last for two years. The spacecraft's mass that entered the atmosphere of Mars was 1,340 lb (608 kg).There were  three major stages to InSight's landing: Landing sequence: The lander's mass is about 358 kg (789 lb)but on Mars, which has 0.376 of Earth'sgravity, it only weighs the equivalent of a 135 kg (298 lb) object on Earth. On 26 November 2018, InSight successfully touched down in Elysium Planitia. A few hours after landing, NASA's2001 Mars Odysseyorbiter relayed signals indicating thatInSight'ssolar panelshad successfully unfurled and are generating enough electrical power to recharge its batteries daily.Odysseyalso relayed a pair of images showingInSight'slanding site.More images were acquired instereopairs to create 3D images, allowingInSightto find the best locations on the surface to place the heat probe and seismometer. Over the next few weeks,InSightchecked health indicators and monitor both weather and temperature conditions at the landing site. AsInSight'sscience goals are not related to any particular surface feature of Mars, potential landing sites were chosen on the basis of practicality. Candidate sites needed to be near theequatorof Mars to provide sufficient sunlight for the solar panels year round, have a low elevation to allow for sufficient atmospheric braking duringEDL, be flat and relatively rock-free to reduce the probability of complications during landing, and have soft enough terrain to allow the heat flow probe to penetrate well into the ground.[citation needed] An optimal area that meets all these requirements isElysium Planitia, so all 22 initial potential landing sites were located in this area.The only two other areas on the equator and at low elevation,Isidis PlanitiaandValles Marineris, are too rocky. In addition, Valles Marineris has too steep a gradient to allow safe landing. In September 2013, the initial 22 potential landing sites were narrowed down to four, and theMars Reconnaissance Orbiterwas then used to gain more information on each of the four potential sites before a final decision was made.Each site consists of alanding ellipsethat measures about 130 by 27 km (81 by 17 mi). In March 2017, scientists from theJet Propulsion Laboratoryannounced that the landing site had been selected. It is located in western Elysium Planitia at4°30′N135°54′E﻿ / ﻿4.5°N 135.9°E﻿ /4.5; 135.9﻿ (InSightlanding site).The landing site is about 600 km (370 mi) north from where theCuriosityroveris operating inGale Crater. On 26 November 2018, the spacecraft successfully touched down at its landing site,and in early December 2018InSightlander and EDL components were imaged from space on the surface of Mars.The images provided precise position of the lander:4°30′09″N135°37′24″E﻿ / ﻿4.5024°N 135.6234°E﻿ /4.5024; 135.6234. On 26 November 2018, NASA reported that theInSightlander had landed successfully on Mars. The meteorological suite (TWINS) and magnetometer were operational, and the mission took approximately three months to deploy and commission the geophysical science instruments.After landing, the dust was allowed to settle for a few hours, during which time the solar array motors were warmed up and then the solar panels were unfurled.The lander then reported its systems' status, acquired some images, and it powered down tosleep modefor its first night on Mars. On its first sol on Mars it set a new solar power record of 4.6 kilowatt-hours generated for a single Martian day (known as a"sol").This amount is enough to support operations and deploy the sensors. On 7 December 2018,InSightrecorded the sounds of Martian winds with SEIS, which is able to record vibrations within human hearing range, although rather low (aka subwoofer-type sounds), and these were sent back to Earth.This was the first time the sound of Mars wind was heardafter two previous attempts. On 19 December 2018, the SEIS instrument was deployed onto the surface of Mars next to the lander by its robotic arm,and it was commissioned on 4 February 2019.After the seismometer became fully operational, the heat probe instrument was deployed on 12 February 2019. In April 2019, NASA reported that the MarsInSightlander detected its firstmarsquake. In September 2019, researchers reported thatInSightuncovered unexplainedmagnetic pulses, andmagnetic oscillations. On 24 February 2020, a summary of studies over the past year from InSight was presented which indicated that the planet Mars has active quakes, dust devils and magnetic pulses. In February 2020, according to new data gathered from NASA's InSight lander, it was found that the Martian magnetic field at the landing site is about 10 times stronger than previously thought, and fluctuates rapidly. In early 2021, the InSight team announced they would attempt to detect the arrival of theMars 2020mission using InSight's seismometers. Pre-landing modeling of the signals from Mars 2020'sentry, descent and landingsequence suggested that the most probable source of any potential signal would be the impact of the spacecraft's cruise mass balance devices with the Martian surface, at speeds of around 4000 m/s.Shortly after successfully landing thePerseverance Rover, NASA announced that its landing went undetected by InSight. This helped demonstrate that Mars has a seismic efficiency of less than 3%. On 12 April 2021, it was reported that Insight went into emergency hibernation because itssolar panelswere filled withMartian dust. On 14 April, the lander began to transmit images after waking from hibernation. On 3 May 2021, InSight used its robotic arm to trickle sand beside a solar panel. The InSight team wanted to let the sand blow away and touch the solar panels, sticking some dust particles to it, before leaving the solar panel. The sand trickle resulted in a boost in power of 30 watt-hours per sol. In July 2021 three papers studying Mars's interior structure were published. Seismometer data confirms that the center of Mars is molten. The crust of Mars is thinner than expected and may have two or three sub-layers. In January 2022, InSight went intosafe modedue to aregional dust stormin the area, which caused a reduction in sunlight. During its time in safe mode, all but essential functions were suspended. It left safe mode on 19 January 2022 and resumed normal operations, however all science instruments were left off in the mean time. As of May 2022, Insight has recorded 1,313 marsquakes. The seismometer (SEIS), radio experiment (RISE) and the weather instruments (TWINS) continue to operate as the lander's Mars surface mission was extended by two years, until end of December 2022.The reason the mission was retired was due to insufficient power generation on the solar panels, due to dust accumulation. In August 2024, a reservoir of liquid water was discovered on Mars – deep in the rocky outer crust of the planet. The findings came from a new analysis of seismometer data, which recorded four years' of vibrations – Mars quakes – from deep inside the Red Planet. On 28 February 2019, theHeat Flow and Physical Properties Packageprobe (mole) started digging into the surface of Mars. The probe and its digging mole were intended to reach a maximum depth of 5 m (16 ft) but it only went about 0.35 m (1.1 ft), or three-quarters of the way out of its housing structure. After many attempts, the effort was given up as a failure in January 2021. In October 2019, the researchers at JPL concluded that the soil on Mars does not provide necessary friction for drilling, causing the mole to bounce around and form a wide pit around itself rather than dig deeper. They attempted a maneuver calledpinningin which they pressed the side of the scoop against the mole location to pin the side of the wall of the hole and increase friction.Pinning was initially successful,but then the mole backed out of its hole after a few weeks, suggesting the soil is accumulating below the mole. In February 2020, the team reevaluated the risks of pushing the scoop directly against the back cap of the mole, and determined the procedure to be acceptable. In June 2020, the team reported that the mole was finally underground, and was being evaluated to determine if the mole was able to dig as designed.On 9 July 2020, it was revealed that images taken on 20 June 2020 showed the mole bouncing again, indicating that it did not have sufficient friction to dig deeper. One suggested solution was to partially fill the hole with soil to increase friction. By August 2020, the operations team had made some progress using the scoop to assist the mole in digging deeper into its hole, by pressing against the back. The scoop was used to fill the hole of the partially submerged mole, burying it fully for the first time. The team hoped the mole can now dig further into the surface on its own, possibly with the additional assistance of the scoop. On 14 January 2021, the heat probe part of the mission was declared to be over, after the science team had determined that the soil properties at the landing location were incompatible with what the instrument had been designed for. The team attempted many different remedies over nearly two years to get the mole to burrow into the soil, but in the end, the attempts did not succeed. The friction between the soil and the probe was not enough for the mole to hammer itself down through the soil. Another set of attempts to get the probe deeper took place on 9 January 2021. After they proved unsuccessful, the decision was made to leave the probe as is and end attempts to dig deeper. The mole did, with all the assisting measures, burrow itself completely underground. The top of the mole is 2 to 3 centimetres below the Martian surface. To be able to produce the intended scientific measurements, the mole needed to have dug itself at least 3 metres deep. Thus the mole was unsuccessful at producing its intended scientific results. However the mole's operations did produce useful and interesting results about the soil at the InSight site; about conducting excavation, or drilling, on Mars; and about operating the lander's robotic arm through the mole-rescue efforts that used the arm in ways that were unplanned before the mission. TheMars Cube One(MarCO) spacecraft are a pair of 6UCubeSatsthat piggybacked with theInSightmission to test CubeSat navigation and endurance in deep space, and to help relay real-time communications (with an eight-minute lightspeed delay)during the probe'sentry, descent and landing(EDL) phase.The two 6U CubeSats, named MarCO A and B, are identical.They were launched along withInSight, but separated soon after reaching space,and they flew as a pair for redundancy while flanking the lander.They did not enter orbit, but flew past Mars during the EDL phase of the mission and relayedInSight'stelemetry in real time.The success of the MarCO spacecraft proved the viability of the cubesat platform for deep space missions and helped serve as a technical demonstration for potential future missions of a similar nature. On 5 February 2019, NASA reported that the CubeSats went silent, and are unlikely to be heard from again. TheInSightscience and engineering team includes scientists and engineers from many disciplines, countries and organizations.

Major contributing agencies and institutions are: As part of its public outreach, NASA organized a program where members of the public were able to have their names sent to Mars aboardInSight. Due to its launch delay, two rounds of sign-ups were conducted totaling 2.4 million names:826,923 names were registered in 2015and a further 1.6 million names were added in 2017.Anelectron beamwas used toetchletters only1⁄1000the width of a humanhair(1μm)onto 8 mm (0.3 in)siliconwafers.The first chip was installed on the lander in November 2015 and the second on 23 January 2018.

OSIRIS-REx[a]was aNASAasteroid-study andsample-return missionthat visited and collected samples from101955 Bennu, acarbonaceousnear-Earth asteroid.The material, returned in September 2023, is expected to enable scientists to learn more about theformation and evolution of the Solar System, its initial stages of planet formation, and the source oforganic compoundsthat led to theformation of lifeon Earth.Following the completion of the primary OSIRIS-REx (Regolith Explorer) mission, the spacecraft is planned to conduct a flyby of asteroid99942 Apophis, renamed asOSIRIS-APEX(Apophis Explorer). OSIRIS-REx was launched on September 8, 2016, flew past Earth on 22 September 2017 and rendezvoused withBennuon 3 December 2018.It spent the next two years analyzing the surface to find a suitable site from which to extract a sample. On 20 October 2020, OSIRIS-REx touched down on Bennu and successfully collected a sample.OSIRIS-REx left Bennu on 10 May 2021and returned its sample to Earth on 24 September 2023,subsequently starting its extended mission to study99942 Apophis, where it will arrive in April 2029. Bennu was chosen as the target of study because it is a "time capsule" from the birth of theSolar System.Bennu has a very dark surface and is classified as aB-type asteroid, a sub-type of the carbonaceousC-type asteroids. Such asteroids are considered primitive, having undergone little geological change from their time of formation. In particular, Bennu was selected because of the availability of pristinecarbonaceousmaterial, a key element inorganic moleculesnecessary for life as well as representative of matter from before the formation of Earth. Organic molecules, such asamino acids, have previously been found in meteorite and comet samples, indicating that some ingredients necessary for life can be naturally synthesized in outer space. The cost of the OSIRIS-REx mission is approximately US$800 million,not including theAtlas Vlaunch vehicle, which is about US$183.5 million.The OSIRIS-APEX extended mission costs an additional US$200 million.It is the third planetary science mission selected in theNew Frontiers program, afterJunoandNew Horizons. The principal investigator isDante Laurettafrom theUniversity of Arizona, having taken over in 2011 after the original PIMichael Julian Drakedied four months after the mission won approval from NASA. OSIRIS-REx was the first United States spacecraft to return samples from an asteroid. Previous asteroid returns include the Japanese probesHayabusa, which visited25143 Itokawain 2010, andHayabusa2, which visited162173 Ryuguin June 2018. Overall management, engineering, and navigation for the OSIRIS missions are provided byNASA'sGoddard Space Flight Center, while theUniversity of Arizona'sLunar and Planetary Laboratoryprovides principal science operations.Lockheed Martin Space Systemsbuilt the spacecraft and provides mission operations.The science team includes members from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Italy. After traveling for approximately two years, the spacecraftrendezvousedwith asteroid101955 Bennuin December 2018,and began 505 days of surface mapping at a distance of approximately 5 km (3.1 mi).Results of that mapping were used by the mission team to select the site from which to take a sample of at least 60 g (2.1 oz) of material of the asteroid's surface.Then a close approach (without landing) was carried out to allow extension of a robotic arm to gather the sample. Following the successful collection of material (121.6 grams (4.29 oz)),the sample was returned to Earth in a 46 kg (101 lb) capsule similar to that which returned the samples of Comet81P/Wildon the space probeStardust. The return trip to Earth was shorter than the outbound trip. The capsule landed by parachute at theUtah Test and Training Rangeon 24 September 2023 and was transported to theJohnson Space Centerfor processing in a dedicated research facility. The launch was on 8 September 2016 at 23:05UTCon aUnited Launch AllianceAtlas V411fromCape Canaveral,Space Launch Complex 41.The 411 rocket configuration consists of aRD-180powered first stage with a singleAJ-60Asolid fuel booster, and aCentaurupper stage.OSIRIS-REx separated from the launch vehicle 55 minutes after ignition.The launch was declared "exactly perfect" by the mission'sprincipal investigator, with no anomalies before or during launch. OSIRIS-REx entered the cruise phase shortly after separation from the launch vehicle, following successful solar panel deployment, propulsion system initiation, and establishment of a communication link with Earth.Itshyperbolic escape speedfrom Earth was about 5.41 km/s (3.36 mi/s).On 28 December 2016, the spacecraft successfully performed its first deep space maneuver to change its velocity by 431 m/s (1,550 km/h) using 354 kg (780 lb) of fuel.An additional, smaller firing of its thrusters on 18 January 2017 further refined its course for an Earthgravity assiston 22 September 2017.The cruise phase lasted until its encounter with Bennu in December 2018,after which it entered its science and sample collection phase. During its cruise phase, OSIRIS-REx was used to search for a class ofnear-Earth objectsknown asEarth-Trojan asteroidsas it passed through Sun–EarthL4Lagrange point. Between 9 and 20 February 2017, the OSIRIS-REx team used the spacecraft's MapCam camera to search for the objects, taking about 135 survey images each day for processing by scientists at the University of Arizona. The search was beneficial even though no new trojans were found,as it closely resembled the operation required as the spacecraft approached Bennu, searching for natural satellites and other potential hazards.On 12 February 2017, while 673×10^6km (418×10^6mi) fromJupiter, the PolyCam instrument aboard OSIRIS-REx successfully imaged the giant planet and three of its moons,Callisto,Io, andGanymede. OSIRIS-REx flew by Earth on 22 September 2017. On 3 December 2018, NASA confirmed that OSIRIS-REx had matched the speed and orbit of Bennu at a distance of about 19 km (12 mi), effectively reaching the asteroid. OSIRIS-REx performed closer passes of the Bennu surface, initially at about 6.5 km (4.0 mi) through December to further refine the shape and orbit of Bennu. Preliminary spectroscopic surveys of the asteroid's surface by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft detected the presence ofhydrated mineralsin the form ofclay. While researchers suspect that Bennu was too small to host water, the hydroxyl groups may have come from water present in its parent body before Bennu split off. OSIRIS-REx entered orbit around Bennu on 31 December 2018 at about 1.75 km (1.09 mi) to start its extensive remote mapping and sensing campaign for the selection of a sample site. This is the closest distance that any spacecraft has orbited a celestial object, closer than theRosetta'sorbit of comet67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenkoat 7 km (4.3 mi).At this altitude, it took the spacecraft 62 hours to orbit Bennu.At the end of its detailed survey, the spacecraft entered a closer orbit with a radius of 1 km (0.62 mi). Rehearsals were performed before sampling, during which the solar arrays were raised into a Y-shaped configuration to minimize the chance of dust accumulation during contact and provide more ground clearance in case the spacecraft tipped over (up to 45°) during contact.The descent was very slow, minimizing thruster firings prior to contact to reduce the likelihood of asteroid surface contamination by unreactedhydrazinepropellant. On 20 October 2020, contact with the surface of Bennu was detected using accelerometers, and the impact force was dissipated by a spring in the TAGSAM arm. Upon surface contact by the TAGSAM instrument, a burst ofnitrogengas was released to blowregolithparticles smaller than 2 cm (0.8 in) into the sampler head at the end of the robotic arm. A five-second timer limited the collection time to mitigate the chance of a collision, and the probe then executed a back-away maneuver to depart safely. The plan was then for OSIRIS-REx to perform a braking maneuver a few days later to halt the drift away from the asteroid in case it was necessary to return for another sampling attempt. It would then take images of the TAGSAM head to verify a sample had been acquired. If a sample was acquired, the spacecraft would rotate about the short axis of the sample arm to determine sample mass by measuring momentum of inertia and determine if it was in excess of the required 60 g (2.1 oz). Both the braking and rotation maneuvers were canceled when images of the sample container clearly showed a large excess of material was collected, some of which was able to escape through the container's seal because some material had jammed the mechanism open. The collected material was scheduled for immediate storage in the Sample-Return Capsule.On 28 October 2020, the sample collector head was secured in the return capsule. Following the separation of the head from the collector arm, the arm was retracted into its launch configuration, and the Sample-Return Capsule lid was closed and latched preparing to return to Earth. In addition to the bulk sampling mechanism, contact pads on the end of the sampling head made of tiny stainless steel loops (Velcro)passively collected dust grains smaller than1 mm. NASA selected the final four candidate sample sites in August 2019, named Nightingale, Kingfisher, Osprey, and Sandpiper.On 12 December 2019, they announced that Nightingale had been selected as the primary sample site and Osprey was selected as the backup site.Both were within craters, with Nightingale near Bennu's north pole while Osprey was near the equator. NASA planned to perform the first sampling in late August 2020;NASA's originally planned Touch-and-Go (TAG) sample collection was scheduled for 25 August 2020, but was rescheduled for 20 October 2020, at 22:13 UTC.On 15 April 2020, the first sample collection rehearsal was successfully performed at the Nightingale sample site. The exercise took OSIRIS-REx as close as 65 m (213 ft) from the surface before performing a back-away burn.A second rehearsal was successfully completed on 11 August 2020, bringing OSIRIS-REx down to 40 m (130 ft) from the surface. This was the final rehearsal before the sample collection scheduled for 20 October 2020, at 22:13 UTC. At 22:13 UTC, on October 20, 2020, OSIRIS-REx successfully touched down on Bennu at a distance of 200 million miles (320 million kilometers) from Earth.NASA confirmed via images taken during sampling that the sampler had made contact. The spacecraft touched down within 92 cm (36 in) of the target location.A sample of the asteroid which was estimated to weigh at least 2 ounces (57 grams) was collected by OSIRIS-REx following the touch down.After imaging the TAGSAM head, NASA concluded that there were rocks wedged in the mylar flap meant to keep the sample inside, causing the sample to slowly escape into space.In order to prevent further loss of the sample through the flaps, NASA canceled the previously planned spinning maneuver meant to determine the mass of the sample as well as a navigational braking maneuver, and decided to stow the sample on 27 October 2020 rather than 2 November 2020 as originally planned, which was completed successfully. The collector head was observed hovering over theSample Return Capsule(SRC) after the TAGSAM arm moved it into the proper position for capture, and the collector head was later secured onto the capture ring in the SRC. When the head was seated into the Sample-Return Capsule's capture ring on 28 October 2020, the spacecraft performed a "backout check", which commanded the TAGSAM arm to back out of the capsule. This maneuver is designed to tug on the collector head and ensure that the latches – which keep the collector head in place – are well secured. Following the test, the mission team received telemetry confirming that the head was properly secured in the Sample-Return Capsule. Thereafter, on 28 October 2020, two mechanical parts on the TAGSAM arm were disconnected – these are the tube that carried the nitrogen gas to the TAGSAM head during sample collection and the TAGSAM arm itself. Over the next several hours, the mission team commanded the spacecraft to cut the tube that stirred up the sample through the TAGSAM head during sample collection, and separate the collector head from the TAGSAM arm. Once the team confirmed these activities were done, it commanded the spacecraft on 28 October 2020, to close and seal the Sample-Return Capsule, the final step of the sample stowage process of Bennu's samples.To seal the SRC, the spacecraft closed the lid and then secured two internal latches. On inspecting images, it was observed that a few particles had escaped from the collector head during the stowage procedure, but it was confirmed that no particles would hinder the stowage process, since the team was confident that a plentiful amount of material remained inside of the head, more than the 60 g (2.1 oz) needed, that is, 121.6 g (4.29 oz).The sample of Bennu was safely stored and ready for its journey to Earth. With the collector head secure inside the SRC, pieces of the sample would no longer be lost. On 7 April 2021, OSIRIS-REx completed its final flyover of Bennu and began drifting away from the asteroid.On 10 May 2021, the spacecraft departed the vicinity of Bennu and began its two-year journey to Earth with the asteroid sample. On 24 September 2023, at 4:42 a.m.MDT, at a distance of 63,000 miles (101,000 kilometers) from Earth, it ejected the sample return capsule, which re-enteredthe atmosphereat 27,650 miles per hour (44,500 km/h).Due to a mistake in wiring, the drogue parachute did not deploy as planned at 100,000 feet (30,400 meters).However, the main parachute was released when the spacecraft reached about 9,000 feet (2,700 meters), and it survived deployment despite higher than anticipated speeds.About 8:52 a.m.MDTthe capsule landed at 11 mph (18 km/h) at theUtah Test and Training Range, one minute earlier than predicted.The main spacecraft maneuvered to a trajectory away from Earth for its extended mission toApophisin 2029 calledOSIRIS-APEX. At 10:15 a.m. MDT, the capsule was taken from the landing site by helicopter. The sample will beanalyzedat NASA'sAstromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate(ARES) and at Japan'sExtraterrestrial Sample Curation Center.Asteroid sample material requests will be considered and distributed to organizations worldwide by ARES. On 11 October 2023, the recovered capsule was opened to reveal a "first look" at the asteroid sample contents.Further looks were reported on 13 December 2023 and revealedorganic moleculesand unknown materials that require study to determine their composition. Some damaged fasteners prevented immediate opening, but, after three months, on 13 January 2024, NASA reported fully opening the recovered container.In total, 121.6 g (4.29 oz) of asteroidal material was recovered from the sample container. The samples became available to the world’s scientists for research by request on 1 April 2024.On 15 May 2024, an overview of preliminary analytical studies on the returned samples was reported.In January 2025, NASA revealed that while the samples did not show evidence of life in an early solar system, their contents suggest that the conditions necessary for the emergence of life were likely widespread across it.These findings have prompted scientists to wonder why life did not emerge from Bennu. Further, they theorize that the amount of ammonia, which is a volatile substance, in the samples indicates that Bennu emerged from the colder, outer regions of space. In January 2025, it was reported that a wide range of carbon- and nitrogen-rich organic compounds have been identified in samples returned from Bennu, including 14 of the 20 amino acids that make up proteins in terrestrial organisms, as well as all four nucleobases (adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine) that are the essential building blocks of DNA and RNA. The samples contain a nearly equal mix of left-handed (L) and right-handed (D) amino acids, raising questions about whether asteroids like Bennu helped shape Earth's biochemistry. On 25 April 2022, NASA confirmed that the mission would be extended. After dropping off its sample to Earth on 24 September 2023, the mission becameOSIRIS-APEX('APophis EXplorer').As the new name suggests, its next target will be thenear-Earth asteroid(andpotentially hazardous object)99942 Apophis. Apophis will make an extremely close pass to the Earth on 13 April 2029, although there is no chance for an impact during this or any subsequent flybys in the near future. Observations of Apophis will commence on 8 April 2029, and a few days later, on 21 April, OSIRIS-APEX is planned to rendezvous with the asteroid.OSIRIS-APEX will orbit Apophis for around 18 months in a regime similar to that at Bennu. The spacecraft will perform a maneuver, similar to sample collection at Bennu, by using its thrusters to disturb Apophis's surface, in order to expose and spectrally study the subsurface and the material beneath it.However, the proposed FY2026 budget cuts funding for OSIRIS-APEX, and it is set to be shut down. OSIRIS-REx and OSIRIS-APEX are acronyms, and each letter or combination of letters relates to part of the respective projects: Each of these words was chosen to represent an aspect of this mission.For example, the S, for security means the security of Earth from impact by hazardousnear-Earth objects(NEOs).Specifically it refers to better understanding theYarkovsky effect, which can alter the trajectories of orbiting bodies.Regolith Explorer means that the mission will study the texture, morphology,geochemistry, and spectral properties of the regolith of asteroid Bennu while Apophis Explorer corresponds to the study of Apophis asteroid. When its heritage concept was proposed in theDiscovery Programin 2004, it was called only OSIRIS, with REx for "Regolith Explorer" used descriptively rather than as part of the name. The mission name itself was a reference to the godOsiris. Dante Lauretta, deputy PI of the mission, was called "a mythology buff" by the mission PI Michael Drake: "he was doodling on a pad and trying to capture the principal themes of what we are trying to do with this mission—study life origins, identify resources, planetary security in the form of asteroid deflection—and he realized he got the name of Osiris out of that, an ancient god of Egypt who may have been one of the first pharaohs."Similar to how Osiris in mythology taught agriculture to humanity which brought civilization and life to Egypt, OSIRIS-REx aims to return samples from an asteroid that may contain organics that led to the origin of life on Earth.Rexis the Latin word for king which is a reference to Osiris being a mythical king of Egypt. Asteroid Bennu is named after the mythological bird from ancientEgyptian mythologythat was associated with the Sun and the creation of the cosmos, while the asteroid for the second mission is named after the ancient Egyptian godApophis, who was associated with chaos and destruction.Both asteroids Bennu and Apophis are named after figures in Egyptian mythology just like OSIRIS-REx. The science objectives of the mission are: Telescopic observations have helped define the orbit of101955 Bennu, anear-Earth object(NEO) with a mean diameter in the range of 480 to 511 m (1,575 to 1,677 ft).It completes an orbit of theSunevery 436.604 days (1.2 years). This orbit takes it close to the Earth every six years. Although the orbit is reasonably well known, scientists continue to refine it. It is critical to know the orbit of Bennu because recent calculations produced a cumulative probability of 1 in 1410 (or 0.071%) of impact with Earth from 2169 to 2199.One of the mission objectives is to refine understanding of non-gravitational effects (such as theYarkovsky effect) on this orbit, and the implications of those effects for Bennu's collision probability. Knowing Bennu's physical properties will be critical for future scientists to understand when developing anasteroid impact avoidancemission. In addition to its telecommunication equipment, the spacecraft carries a suite of instruments to image and analyze the asteroid on many wavelengths,and retrieve a physical sample to return to Earth.The Planetary Societycoordinated a campaign to invite interested persons to have their names or artwork on the mission's spirit of exploration saved on a microchip carried in the spacecraft. The OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite (OCAMS) consists of the PolyCam, the MapCam, and the SamCam.Together, they acquire information on asteroid Bennu by providing global mapping, sample site reconnaissance and characterization, high-resolution imaging, and records of the sample acquisition. The OSIRIS-REx Visible and IR Spectrometer (OVIRS) is aspectrometerwhich maps minerals and organic substances on the asteroid's surface.It provides full-disc asteroid spectral data at 20 m resolution. It maps blue to near-infrared,400–4300 nm, with aspectral resolutionof7.5–22 nm.This data was used in concert with OTES spectra to guide sample-site selection. The spectral ranges and resolving powers are sufficient to provide surface maps ofcarbonates,silicates,sulfates,oxides,adsorbed waterand a wide range oforganic compounds.[citation needed] The OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer (OTES) providesthermal emission spectralmaps and local spectral information of candidate sample sites in thethermal infraredchannel covering 4–50 μm, again to map mineral and organic substances.Thewavelengthrange, spectral resolution, and radiometric performance are sufficient to resolve and identify silicates, carbonates, sulfates, phosphates, oxides, and hydroxide minerals. OTES is also used to measure the total thermal emission from Bennu in support of the requirement to measure emitted radiation globally.[citation needed] Based on the performance ofMini-TESin the dusty surface environment of Mars, OTES was designed to be resilient to extreme dust contamination on the optical elements.[citation needed] The Regolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) provided anX-ray spectroscopymap of Bennu to map element abundances.REXIS was a collaborative development by four groups withinMassachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT) andHarvard University, with the potential to involve more than 100 students throughout the process. REXIS was based on flight heritage hardware, thereby minimizing elements of technical risk, schedule risk, and cost risk. REXIS is acoded aperturesoft X-ray (0.3–7.5 keV) telescope that images X-ray fluorescence line emission produced by the absorption of solar X-rays and thesolar windby elements in the regolith of Bennu leading to local X-ray emissions. Images were formed with 21arcminuteresolution (4.3 m spatial resolution at a distance of 700 m). Imaging was achieved by correlating the detected X-ray image with a 64×64 element random mask (1.536 mm pixels). REXIS stored data for each X-ray event to maximize data storage usage and minimize the risk. Thepixelswere addressed in 64×64 bins and the 0.3–7.5 keV range was covered by five broad bands and 11 narrow line bands. A 24-second resolution time tag was interleaved with the event data to account for Bennu rotation. Images were reconstructed on the ground after downlink of the event list. Images were formed simultaneously in 16 energy bands centered on the dominant lines of abundant surface elements from O-K (0.5 keV) to Fe-Kß (7 keV) as well the representative continuum. During orbital phase 5B, a 21-day orbit 700 m from the surface of Bennu, a total of at least 133 events/asteroid pixel/energy band were expected under 2 keV; enough to obtain significant constraints on element abundances at scales larger than 10 m.[citation needed] On 11 November 2019, while observing the asteroid with REXIS, university students and researchers involved in the mission unexpectedly discovered an X-ray burst from ablack holenamed MAXI J0637-430 located 30,000 light-years away. The OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter (OLA) is a scanning andlidarinstrument that will provide high resolution topographical information throughout the mission.The information received by OLA creates globaltopographicmaps of Bennu, local maps of candidate sample sites, ranging in support of other instruments, and support navigation and gravity analyses.[citation needed] OLA scans the surface of Bennu at specific intervals to rapidly map the entire surface of the asteroid to achieve its primary objective of producing local and global topographic maps. The data collected by OLA will also be used to develop a control network relative to the center of mass of the asteroid and to enhance and refine gravitational studies of Bennu.[citation needed] OLA has a single common receiver and two complementary transmitter assemblies that enhance the resolution of the information brought back. OLA's high-energy laser transmitter is used for ranging and mapping from 1 to 7.5 km (0.62 to 4.66 mi). The low-energy transmitter is used for ranging and imaging from 0.5 to 1 km (0.31 to 0.62 mi). The repetition rate of these transmitters sets the data acquisition rate of OLA. Laser pulses from both the low and high energy transmitters are directed onto a movable scanning mirror, which is co-aligned with the field of view of the receiver telescope limiting the effects of background solar radiation. Each pulse provides target range, azimuth, elevation, received intensity and a time-tag.[citation needed] OLA was funded by theCanadian Space Agency(CSA) and was built byMDAatBrampton,Ontario, Canada.OLA was delivered for integration with the spacecraft on 17 November 2015.The lead instrument scientist of OLA is Michael Daly fromYork University. The sample-return system, called Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM), consists of a sampler head with an articulated 3.35 m (11.0 ft) arm.An on-board nitrogen source supports up to three separate sampling attempts to acquire at least 60 g (2.1 oz) of sample in all. The surface contact pads also collect fine-grained material.[citation needed] Highlights of the TAGSAM instrument and technique include: Hayabusa2is a similar mission fromJAXAto collect samples from near-Earth asteroid162173 Ryugu. It arrived at theasteroidin June 2018, left in November 2019 after two successful sample collections, and returned to Earth in December 2020. The recovery capsule of Hayabusa2 re-entered Earth atmosphere and landed in Australia, as planned, on 5 December 2020. The sample contents were to be extensively analyzed, including water content, to provide clues on the initial formation of the asteroid. The main module of Hayabusa2 is performing a swing-by procedure to "push" it onward to its next destination, asteroid 1998KY26, by 2031. Because the two missions were similar and had overlapping timelines (OSIRIS-REx was still in the return phase), NASA and JAXA signed an agreement to collaborate on sample exchange and research.The two teams visited each other, with representatives from JAXA visiting the OSIRIS-REx Science Operations Center at theUniversity of Arizona, and members of the OSIRIS-REx team traveling to Japan to meet with the Hayabusa2 team.The teams are sharing software, data, and techniques for analysis, and will eventually exchange portions of the samples that are returned to Earth. OSIRIS-REx II was a 2012 mission concept to replicate the original spacecraft for a double mission, with the second vehicle collecting samples from the two moons of Mars,PhobosandDeimos. It was stated that this mission would be both the quickest and least expensive way to get samples from the moons. Mars I and II are now the aims of another mission, led by JAXA, calledMMX, to be launched in 2026.

TheParker Solar Probe(PSP; previouslySolar Probe,Solar Probe PlusorSolar Probe+)is aNASAspace probelaunched in 2018 to make observations of theSun's outer corona. It used repeatedgravity assistsfromVenusto develop an eccentric orbit, approaching within 9.86solar radii(6.9 million km or 4.3 million miles)from the center of the Sun. At its closest approach in 2024, its speed relative to the Sun was 690,000 km/h (430,000 mph) or 191 km/s (118.7 mi/s), which is 0.064%  thespeed of light.It is the fastest object ever built onEarth. The project was announced in the fiscal 2009 budget year.Johns Hopkins UniversityApplied Physics Laboratorydesigned and built the spacecraft,which was launched on 12 August 2018.It became the first NASA spacecraft named after a living person, honoring physicistEugene Newman Parker,professor emeritusat theUniversity of Chicago. On 29 October 2018, at about 18:04 UTC, the spacecraft became the closest ever artificial object to the Sun. The previous record, 42.73 million kilometers (26.55 million miles) from the Sun's surface, was set by theHelios 2spacecraft in April 1976.At itsperihelionon 27 September 2023, the PSP's closest approach was 7.26 million kilometers (4.51 million miles),reaching this distance again on 29 March 2024. On 24 December 2024 at 11:53 UTC, PSP made its closest approach to the Sun, coming to a distance of 6.1 million km (3.8 million miles) from the surface. Its beacon signal was received on 26 December, showing that it had survived the passage through the corona.Detailed telemetry was received 1 January 2025. In 2025, the teams from NASA, Johns Hopkins, and partners were awarded the 2024Collier Trophyfor their achievements. The Parker Solar Probe concept originates in the 1958 report by the Fields and Particles Group, Committee 8 of theNational Academy of Sciences' Space Science Board,which proposed several space missions including "a solar probe to pass inside the orbit of Mercury to study the particles and fields in the vicinity of the Sun". Studies in the 1970s and 1980s reaffirmed its importance,but it was always postponed due to cost. A cost-reduced Solar Orbiter mission was studied in the 1990s, and a more capable Solar Probe mission served as one of the centerpieces of the Outer Planet/Solar Probe (OPSP) program formulated byNASAin the late 1990s. The first three missions of the program were planned to be: theSolar Orbiter, thePlutoandKuiper beltreconnaissancePluto Kuiper Expressmission, and theEuropa Orbiterastrobiology mission focused onEuropa. The original Solar Probe design used agravity assistfromJupiterto enter apolar orbitwhich dropped almost directly toward the Sun. While this explored the important solar poles and came even closer to the surface (3R☉, a perihelion of 4R☉),the extreme variation in solar irradiance made for an expensive mission and required aradioisotope thermal generatorfor power. The trip to Jupiter also made for a long mission,3+1⁄2years to first solar perihelion, 8 years to second. Following the appointment ofSean O'Keefeas Administrator of NASA, the entirety of the OPSP program was canceled as part of PresidentGeorge W. Bush's request for the2003 United States federal budget.Administrator O'Keefe cited a need for a restructuring of NASA and its projects, falling in line with the Bush Administration's wish for NASA to refocus on "research and development, and addressing management shortcomings". In the early 2010s, plans for the Solar Probe mission were incorporated into a lower-costSolar Probe Plus.The redesigned mission uses multiple Venus gravity assists for a more direct flight path, which can be powered bysolar panels. It has a higher perihelion, reducing the demands on the thermal protection system. In May 2017, the spacecraft was renamed the Parker Solar Probe in honor of astrophysicistEugene Newman Parker,who had proposed the existence ofnanoflaresas an explanation ofcoronal heatingas well as having developed a mathematical theory that predicted the existence ofsolar wind.The solar probe cost NASA US$1.5 billion.The launch rocket bore a dedication in memory ofAPLengineer Andrew A. Dantzler who had worked on the project. Amemory cardcontaining names submitted by over 1.1 million people was mounted on a plaque and installed below the spacecraft's high-gain antenna.The card also contains photos of Parker and a copy of his 1958 scientific paper predicting important aspects ofsolar physics. The Parker Solar Probe is the first spacecraft to fly into the low solar corona. It will assess the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal plasma and magnetic field, the energy flow that heats the solar corona and impels the solar wind, and the mechanisms that accelerate energetic particles. The spacecraft's systems are protected from the extreme heat and radiation near theSunby a solar shield. Incident solar radiation at perihelion is approximately650 kW/m2, or 475 times theintensity at Earth orbit.: 31The solar shield is hexagonal, mounted on the Sun-facing side of the spacecraft, 2.3 m (7 ft 7 in) in diameter,11.4 cm (4.5 in) thick, and is made of two panels ofreinforced carbon–carboncomposite with a lightweight 11-centimeter-thick (4.5 in) carbon foam core,which is designed to withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft of about 1,370 °C (2,500 °F).The shield weighs only 73 kilograms (160 lb) and keeps the spacecraft's instruments at 29 °C (85 °F). A white reflectivealuminasurface layer minimizes absorption. The spacecraft systems andscientific instrumentsare located in the central portion of the shield's shadow, where direct radiation from the Sun is fully blocked. If the shield was not between the spacecraft and the Sun, the probe would be damaged and become inoperative within tens of seconds. As radio communication with Earth takes about eight minutes in each direction, the Parker Solar Probe has to act autonomously and rapidly to protect itself. This is done using four light sensors to detect the first traces of directsunlightcoming from the shield limits and engaging movements fromreaction wheelsto reposition the spacecraft within the shadow again. According to project scientist Nicky Fox, the team described it as "the most autonomous spacecraft that has ever flown". The primary power for the mission is a dual system ofsolar panels(photovoltaic arrays). A primary photovoltaic array, used for the portion of the mission outside0.25 au, is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the Sun, and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach. This secondary array uses pumped-fluid cooling to maintainoperating temperatureof the solar panels and instrumentation. The Parker Solar Probe mission design used repeatedgravity assistsatVenusto incrementally decrease its orbitalperihelionto achieve a final altitude (above the surface) of approximately 8.5 solar radii, or about 6×10^6km (3.7×10^6mi; 0.040 au).The spacecraft trajectory included seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its elliptical orbit around the Sun, for a total of 24 orbits.The near Sun radiation environment was predicted to causespacecraft chargingeffects, radiation damage in materials and electronics, and communication interruptions, so the orbit is highly elliptical with short times spent near the Sun. The trajectory required high launch energy, so the probe was launched on aDelta IV Heavylaunch vehicleand an upper stage based on theStar 48BVsolid rocket motor.Interplanetarygravity assistsprovided further deceleration relative to itsheliocentric orbit, which resulted in a heliocentric speed record atperihelion.As the probe passed around theSunin December 2024, it achieved a velocity of 690,000 km/h (430,000 mph) or 191 km/s (118.7 mi/s) in theheliocentric ecliptic reference frame, which temporarily made it the fastest human-made object, almost three times as fast as the previous record holder,Helios-2. Launch injection was very close to predictions, but nevertheless required path correction. Trajectory was re-optimized after the launch to save fuel. The first Venus flyby was only 52 days after the launch; three trajectory correction maneuvers were performed in this window. As described byKepler's laws of planetary motion, which apply to any object in an orbit, gravity will cause the spacecraft to accelerate as it nears perihelion, then slow down again afterward until it reaches itsaphelion. Because of its highly elliptical orbit and the Sun's strong gravity, this effect is particularly pronounced for the Parker Solar Probe.  During a perihelion on September 27, 2023, the spacecraft traveled at 394,736 miles per hour (176.5 km/s), fast enough to fly from New York to Tokyo in just over a minute. The final gravity assist of the Parker Solar Probe mission occurred on November 6, 2024, which set the spacecraft on a new orbit passing 6.1 million kilometers (3.8 million miles) from the surface of the Sun.A beacon transmission was made and received successfully on December 20 to confirm that the craft was operating normally ahead of the perihelion.  The exact time of closest approach was 11:53 UTC on December 24 but the craft was out of contact at this time.  A further beacon transmission confirming successful passage was received on December 26. This final orbit is inside the orbit of Venus and so no further encounters with that planet are planned.  It will continue in this orbit but requiring adjustment to maintain attitude so that its transmitters point at Earth.  Eventually its thrusters will run out of fuel and full functioning will not then be possible.  The plan is to then rotate the craft so that its instruments will be exposed to the full radiance of the Sun for the first time.  This is expected to ablate and destroy them.  The heat shield will remain though and is expected to continue to orbit the Sun for millions of years. Parker Solar Probe has four main instruments: An additional theoretical investigation named Heliospheric origins with Solar Probe Plus (HeliOSPP) starting from 2010 and ending in 2024 has the role of providing theoretical input and independent assessment of scientific performance to the Science Working Group (SWG) and the SPP Project to maximize the scientific return from the mission. The Principal Investigator is Marco Velli at theUniversity of California, Los Angelesand theJet Propulsion Laboratory; he also serves as the Observatory Scientist for the mission. The Parker Solar Probe was launched on 12 August 2018, at 07:31 UTC. The spacecraft operated nominally after launching. During its first week in space it deployed its high-gain antenna, magnetometer boom, and electric field antennas.The spacecraft performed its first scheduled trajectory correction on 20 August 2018, while it was 8.8 million kilometers (5.5 million mi) from Earth, and travelling at 63,569 kilometers per hour (39,500 mph) Instrument activation and testing began in early September 2018. On 9 September 2018, the two WISPR telescopic cameras performed a successfulfirst-lighttest, transmitting wide-angle images of the background sky towards theGalactic Center. The probe successfully performed the first of the seven planned Venus flybys on 3 October 2018, where it came within about 2,400 kilometers (1,500 mi) of Venus in order to reduce the probe's speed and orbit closer to the Sun. Within each orbit of the Parker Solar Probe around the Sun, the portion within 0.25 AU is the Science Phase, in which the probe is actively and autonomously making observations. Communication with the probe is largely cut off in that phase.: 4Science phases run for a few days both before and after each perihelion. They lasted 11.6 days for the earliest perihelion, and will drop to 9.6 days for the final, closest perihelion.: 8 Much of the rest of each orbit is devoted to transmitting data from the science phase. But during this part of each orbit, there are still periods when communication is not possible. First, the requirement that the heat shield of the probe be pointed towards the Sun sometimes puts the heat shield between the antenna and Earth. Second, even when the probe is not particularly near the Sun, when the angle between the probe and the Sun, as seen from Earth, is too small, the Sun's radiation can overwhelm the communication link.: 11–14 After the firstVenusflyby, the probe was in anelliptical orbitwith a period of 150 days (two-thirds the period of Venus), making three orbits while Venus makes two. After the second flyby, the period shortened to 130 days. After less than two orbits, only 198 days later, it encountered Venus a third time at a point earlier in the orbit of Venus. This encounter shortened its period to half of that of Venus, or about 112.5 days. After two orbits it met Venus a fourth time at about the same place, shortening its period to about 102 days. After 237 days, it met Venus for the fifth time and its period was shortened to about 96 days, three-sevenths that of Venus. It then made seven orbits while Venus made three. The sixth encounter, almost two years after the fifth, shortened its period down to 92 days, two-fifths that of Venus. After five more orbits (two orbits of Venus), it met Venus for the seventh and last time, decreasing its period to 88 or 89 days and allowing it to approach closer to the Sun. PSP's mission can be extended beyond main mission that will end in 2025. Currently discussed plan is "to complete the solar cycle at the 9.86 Rs perihelion distance". On November 6, 2018, Parker Solar Probe observed its firstmagnetic switchbacks– sudden reversals in the direction of themagnetic fieldcarried by the solar wind.They were first observed by the NASA-ESA  missionUlysses, the first spacecraft to fly over the Sun's poles.The switchbacks generate heat that warms solar corona. On 4 December 2019, the first four research papers were published describing findings during the spacecraft's first two dives near the Sun.They reported the direction and strength of the Sun's magnetic field, and described the unusually frequent and short-lived changes in the direction of the Sun's magnetic field. These measurements confirm the hypothesis thatAlfvén wavesare the leading candidates for understanding the mechanisms that underlie thecoronal heating problem.The probe observed approximately a thousand "rogue" magnetic waves in the solar atmosphere that instantly increase solar wind speeds by as much as 300,000 miles per hour (480,000 km/h) and in some cases completely reverse the local magnetic field. They also reported that, using the "beam of electrons that stream along the magnetic field", they were able to observe that "the reversals in the Sun's magnetic field are often associated with localized enhancements in the radial component of the plasma velocity (the velocity in the direction away from the Sun's center)". The researchers found a "surprisingly largeazimuthalcomponent of the plasma velocity (the velocity perpendicular to the radial direction). This component results from the force with which the Sun's rotation slingshots plasma out of the corona when the plasma is released from the coronal magnetic field". PSP discovered evidence of acosmic dust-free zone of 3.5 million miles (5.6 million kilometers) radius from the Sun, due to vaporisation of cosmic dust particles by the Sun's radiation. On April 28, 2021, during its eighth flyby of the Sun, Parker Solar Probe encountered the specific magnetic and particle conditions at 18.8 solar radii that indicated that it penetrated theAlfvén surface;the probe measured the solar wind plasma environment with its FIELDS and SWEAP instruments.This event was described by NASA as "touching the Sun". On 25 September 2022, the first discovery of a comet was made in images from the Parker Solar Probe. The comet is named PSP-001. It was found by Peter Berrett, who participates in the NASA funded Sungrazer project.PSP-001 was discovered in images from 29 May 2022, part of the spacecraft's 12th approach to the Sun. Since this discovery, a further 19sungrazing cometshave been discovered in the images taken by the Parker Solar Probe, including three non-group comets. In 2024, it was reported that the probe detected aKelvin-Helmholtz instability(KHI) during an observedcoronal mass ejection. It is the first spacecraft that detected this long theorized event. The PSP and ESA-NASASolar Orbiter(SolO) missions cooperated to trace solar wind and transients from their sources on the Sun to the inner interplanetary space. In 2022, PSP and SolO planners collaborated to study why the Sun's atmosphere is "150 times hotter" than its surface. SolO observed the Sun from 140 million kilometers, while PSP simultaneously observed the Sun's corona during flyby at a distance of nearly 9 million kilometers. In March 2024, both space probes were at their closest approaches to the Sun, PSP at 7.3 million km, and SolO at 45 million km. SolO observed the Sun, while PSP sampled the plasma of the solar wind, allowing scientists to compare data from both probes. Coordinated observations were also done withSOHOandSTEREO-Aspacecraft.

BepiColombois a joint mission of theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) and theJapan Aerospace Exploration Agency(JAXA) to the planetMercury.The mission comprises two satellites launched together: theMercury Planetary Orbiter(MPO) andMio(Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter,MMO).The mission will perform a comprehensive study of Mercury, including characterization of itsmagnetic field,magnetosphere, and both interior and surface structure. It was launched on anAriane 5rocket on 20 October 2018, with Mercury orbit insertion planned for November 2026, after a flyby ofEarth, two flybys ofVenus, and six flybys of Mercury.The total cost of the mission was estimated in 2017 as US$2 billion. TheBepiColombomission proposal was selected byESAin 2000. Arequest for proposalsfor the science payload was issued in 2004.In 2007,Astrium(nowAirbus Defence and Space) was selected as the prime contractor,andAriane 5chosen as thelaunch vehicle.The initial target launch of July 2014 was postponed several times, mostly because of delays on the development of thesolar electric propulsionsystem.The mission was approved in November 2009, after years in proposal and planning as part of the European Space Agency'sHorizon 2000+programme;it is the last mission of the programme to be launched. ESA is responsible for the overall mission, the design, development assembly and test of the propulsion and MPO modules, and the launch. The two orbiters are operated by mission controllers based inDarmstadt, Germany.The spacecraft operations manager ofBepiColombowas Elsa Montagnon until 2021, and is now Ignacio Clerigo. ESA'sCebreros, Spain35-metre (115 ft) ground station is the primary ground facility for communications during all mission phases.[citation needed] BepiColombois named afterGiuseppe "Bepi" Colombo(1920–1984), ascientist,mathematicianandengineerat theUniversity of Padua,Italy, who first proposed the interplanetarygravity assistmanoeuvre used by the 1974Mariner 10mission, a technique now used frequently by planetary probes. Mio, the name of the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter, was selected from thousands of suggestions by the Japanese public. In Japanese,Miomeans a waterway, and according to JAXA, it symbolizes the research and development milestones reached thus far, and wishes for safe travel ahead. JAXA said the spacecraft will travel through thesolar windjust like a ship traveling through the ocean.In Chinese and Japanese, Mercury is known as the "water star" (水星) according towǔxíng. The main objectives of the mission are: Mercury is too small and hot for its gravity to retain any significant atmosphere over long periods of time, but it has a "tenuous surface-boundedexosphere"containinghydrogen,helium,oxygen,sodium,calcium,potassiumand other trace elements. Its exosphere is not stable as atoms are continuously lost and replenished from a variety of sources. The mission will study the exosphere composition and dynamics, including generation and escape. The orbiters are equipped with scientific instruments provided by various European countries and Japan. The mission will characterize the solid and liquid ironcore(3⁄4of the planet's radius) and determine the size of each.The mission will also completegravitationalandmagnetic fieldmappings. Russia providedgamma rayandneutron spectrometersto verify the existence of water ice in polar craters that are permanently in shadow from the Sun's rays. The mission involves three components, which will separate into independent spacecraft upon arrival at Mercury. During the launch and cruise phases, these three components are joined together (with the Magnetospheric Orbiter Sunshield and Interface or MOSIF betweenMioand MPO)to form the Mercury Cruise System (MCS). The stacked spacecraft will take eight years to position itself to enter Mercury orbit. During this time it usessolar-electric propulsionand nine gravity assists, flying past the Earth and Moon in April 2020, Venus in 2020 and 2021, and six Mercury flybys between 2021 and 2025. Expected to arrive in Mercury orbit in November 2026, theMioand MPO satellites will separate and observe Mercury in collaboration for one year, with a possible one-year extension.Although originally expected to enter orbit in December 2025, thruster issues discovered in September 2024 before the fourth Mercury flyby resulted in a delayed arrival of November 2026. The two orbiters were successfully launched together on 20 October 2018.The launch took place onAriane flight VA245fromEurope’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. The stacked spacecraft left Earth with ahyperbolicexcess velocity of 3.475 km/s (2.159 mi/s). Initially, the craft was placed in aheliocentric orbitsimilar to that of Earth. After both the spacecraft and Earth completed one and a half orbits, it returned to Earth to perform agravity-assistmaneuver and was deflected towardsVenus. Following itsEarthflyby in April 2020,BepiColombowas briefly mistaken for anear-Earth asteroid, receiving theprovisional designation2020 GL2. Two consecutive Venus flybys reduced theperihelionnear to the Sun–Mercury distance with almost no need for thrust. A sequence of six Mercury flybys lowered the relative velocity to 1.76 km/s (1.09 mi/s). After the fourth Mercury flyby in 2024, the spacecraft is in an orbit similar to that of Mercury and remains in the general vicinity of the planet. After the potential biomarkerphosphinehas beententatively discoveredin theVenusian atmospherein September 2020, ESA scientists suggeested thatBepiColombomight be able to detect the compound during its twoVenusflybys in 2020 and 2021. However, it was not clear if the spacecreaft's instruments were sufficiently sensitiveand there has been no announcement of such detection since. During the first Venus flyby in October 2020, seven science instruments and a radiation monitor onboard the Mercury Planetary Orbiter, and three instruments onboardMio, were active and gathering data. The observations were coordinated withJAXA'sAkatsuki, the only active spacecraft orbiting Venus at that time, as well as Earth-based observatories. The second Venus flyby in August 2021 happened only 33 hours after another interplanetary spacecraft byESA,Solar Orbiter, completed itsgravity assistat the same planet. Both spacecraft used their science instruments to study the magnetic, plasma, and particle environment around Venus during their flybys, offering unique multipoint datasets. The MPO's MERTIS instrument captured high resolution spectra of the Venus atmosphere and the Mercury Transfer Module's three monitoring cameras (M-CAM) captured a series of black-and-white images of the planet, documenting the various phases of the flyby. During the first Mercury flyby in October 2021, the spacecraft captured its first images of the target planet using the M-CAM monitoring cameras on the Mercury Transfer Module.Some of the scientific instruments on both orbiters were also active during the flyby, exploring the magnetic and particle environment around Mercury and measuring the planet's gravity.During the second flyby in June 2022, the M-CAM cameras imaged, among other targets, the craterHeaneywith a candidate volcano, an important target for the spacecraft's primary mission. This crater has been recently named afterSeamus Heaneyfollowing a request from the M-CAM team. Some of the scientific instruments have been again active, measuring the magnetic, plasma, and particle environment around the spacecraft. During the third flyby in June 2023, the MPPE suite of instruments onMiowas used to map themagnetosphere of Mercury.Based on these data, scientists described various expected features of the magnetosphere, but also made new discoveries: 1) a low latitude layer containing particles with much broader energy range than ever observed on Mercury, 2) energetichydrogenions trapped at low latitude and near the equator, and 3) cold plasma ions ofoxygenandsodium, as well as signatures ofpotassium, which were probably ejected from the planet's surface bymicrometeoritesor thesolar wind. During the fourth flyby in September 2024, the spacecraft had, for the first time, a clear view of Mercury's south pole. The M-CAM 2 and 3 cameras provided images of the polar region, as well as theVivaldi craterand a crater newly named Stoddart afterMargaret Olrog Stoddartfollowing a request from the M-CAM team.During the fifth flyby in December 2024, using the MERTIS instrument,BepiColombobecame the first spacecraft ever to observe Mercury inmid-infraredlight.During the sixth and final Mercury flyby in January 2025, the M-CAM 1 camera imaged thepermanently shadowed cratersProkofiev, Kandinsky, Tolkien, and Gordimer near the planet's north pole. On 15 May 2024, ESA reported an issue preventing the spacecraft's thrusters from operating at full power during a scheduled manoeuvre on 26 April 2024.On 2 September 2024, ESA reported that to compensate for the reduced available thrust, a revised trajectory had been developed that would add 11 months to the cruise, delaying the expected arrival date from 5 December 2025 to November 2026. Four final thrust arcs will reduce the relative velocity to the point where Mercury will "weakly" capture the spacecraft in November 2026 intopolar orbit. Only a small maneuver is needed to bring the craft into an orbit around Mercury with an apocentre of 178,000 kilometres (111,000 mi). The orbiters then separate and will adjust their orbits using chemical thrusters. As of January 2025[update], the mission schedule is: The Mercury Transfer Module (MTM) has a mass of 2,615 kg (5,765 lb), including 1,400 kg (3,100 lb) of xenon propellant, and is located at the base of the stack. Its role is to carry the two science orbiters to Mercury and to support them during the cruise. The MTM is equipped with asolar electric propulsionsystem as the main spacecraft propulsion. Its fourQinetiQ-T6ion thrustersoperate singly or in pairs for a maximum combined thrust of 290 mN,making it the most powerful ion engine array ever operated in space. The MTM supplies electrical power for the two hibernating orbiters as well as for its solar electric propulsion system thanks to two 14-metre-long (46 ft)solar panels.Depending on the probe's distance to theSun, the generated power will range between 7 and 14 kW, each T6 requiring between 2.5 and 4.5 kW according to the desired thrust level. Thesolar electric propulsionsystem has typically very highspecific impulseand lowthrust. This leads to a flight profile with months-long continuous low-thrust braking phases, interrupted by planetarygravity assists, to gradually reduce the velocity of the spacecraft. Moments before Mercury orbit insertion, the MTM will be jettisoned from the spacecraft stack.After separation from the MTM, the MPO will provideMioall necessary power and data resources untilMiois delivered to its mission orbit.[citation needed]Separation ofMiofrom MPO will be accomplished by spin-ejection.[citation needed] The Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) has a mass of 1,150 kg (2,540 lb) and uses a single-sided solar array capable of providing up to 1000wattsand featuring Optical Solar Reflectors to keep its temperature below 200 °C (392 °F). The solar array requires continuous rotation keeping theSunat a low incidence angle in order to generate adequate power while at the same time limiting the temperature. The MPO will carry a payload of 11 instruments, comprising cameras, spectrometers (IR,UV,X-ray,γ-ray,neutron), a radiometer, a laser altimeter, a magnetometer, particle analysers, a Ka-band transponder, and an accelerometer. The payload components are mounted on the nadir side of the spacecraft to achieve low detector temperatures, apart from the MERTIS and PHEBUS spectrometers located directly at the main radiator to provide a better field of view. A high-temperature-resistant 1.0 m (3 ft 3 in) diameterhigh-gain antennais mounted on a short boom on the zenith side of the spacecraft. Communications will be on theX-bandandKa-bandwith an average bit rate of 50kbit/sand a total data volume of 1550Gbit/year. ESA'sCebreros, Spain35-metre (115 ft) ground station is planned to be the primary ground facility for communications during all mission phases. The science payload of the Mercury Planetary Orbiter consists of eleven instruments: Mio, or the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO), developed and built mostly byJapan, has the shape of a short octagonal prism, 180 cm (71 in) long from face to face and 90 cm (35 in) high.It has a mass of 285 kg (628 lb), including a 45 kg (99 lb) scientific payload consisting of 5 instrument groups, 4 for plasma and dust measuring run by investigators from Japan, and onemagnetometerfromAustria. Miowill be spin stabilized at 15rpmwith the spin axis perpendicular to the equator of Mercury. It will enter a polar orbit at an altitude of 590 × 11,640 km (370 × 7,230 mi), outside of MPO's orbit.The top and bottom of the octagon act as radiators with louvers for active temperature control. The sides are covered withsolar cellswhich provide 90 watts. Communications with Earth will be through a 0.8 m (2 ft 7 in) diameterX-bandphased arrayhigh-gain antennaand two medium-gain antennas operating in the X-band. Telemetry will return 160Gb/year, about 5kbit/sover the lifetime of the spacecraft, which is expected to be greater than one year. The reaction and control system is based oncold gas thrusters. After its release in Mercury orbit,Miowill be operated bySagamihara Space Operation CenterusingUsuda Deep Space Center's64 m (210 ft) antenna located inNagano, Japan. Miocarries five groups of science instruments with a total mass of 45 kg (99 lb): TheMioorbiter requires additional thermal control on the cruise to Mercury, in addition to umbilicals to the MPO. The European Space Agency thus provided the Magnetospheric Orbiter Sunshield and Interface (MOSIF), a white shroud that is shaped like a conical frustrum to provide clearance, asMiois spun up during its separation in 2026, before being ejected from the MPO. The Mercury Surface Element (MSE) was cancelled in 2003 due to budgetary constraints.At the time of cancellation, MSE was meant to be a small, 44 kg (97 lb), lander designed to operate for about one week on the surface of Mercury.Shaped as a 0.9 m (2 ft 11 in) diameter disc, it was designed to land at a latitude of 85° near the terminator region. Braking manoeuvres would bring the lander to zero velocity at an altitude of 120 m (390 ft) at which point the propulsion unit would be ejected, airbags inflated, and the module would fall to the surface with a maximum impact velocity of 30 m/s (98 ft/s). Scientific data would be stored onboard and relayed via a cross-dipoleUHFantenna to either the MPO orMio. The MSE would have carried a 7 kg (15 lb) payload consisting of an imaging system (a descent camera and a surface camera), a heat flow and physical properties package, analpha particle X-ray spectrometer, amagnetometer, aseismometer, a soil penetrating device (mole), and a micro-rover.

TheJupiter Icy Moons Explorer(Juice, formerlyJUICE) is aninterplanetary spacecraftdeveloped by theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) and on its way to orbit and study threeicy moonsofJupiter:Ganymede,Callisto, andEuropa. Theseplanetary-mass moonsare planned to be studied because they are thought to have significant bodies of liquid water beneath their frozen surfaces, which would make thempotentially habitableforextraterrestrial life. Juiceis the first interplanetaryspacecraft to the outer Solar System planetsnot launched by theUnited Statesand the first set to orbit a moon other than Earth'sMoon. Launched by ESA, fromGuiana Space CentreinFrench Guianaon 14 April 2023, withAirbus Defence and Spaceas the main contractor,it is expected to reach Jupiter in July 2031 after fourgravity assistsand eight years of travel.In December 2034, the spacecraft will enter orbit around Ganymede for its close-up science mission.Its period of operations will overlap withNASA'sEuropa Clippermission, which was launched in October 2024. The mission started as a reformulation of theJupiter Ganymede Orbiterproposal, which was to beESA's component of the cancelledEuropa Jupiter System Mission – Laplace(EJSM-Laplace).It became a candidate for the first L-class mission (L1) of the ESACosmic VisionProgramme, and its selection was announced on 2 May 2012. In April 2012,Juicewas recommended over the proposedX-raytelescopeATHENAand thegravitational waveobservatoryLISA (under the older name NGO).Both unsuccessful mission proposals have been selected later and are under development as of 2025. In July 2015,Airbus Defence and Spacewas selected as the prime contractor to design and build the probe, to be assembled inToulouse,France.In 2024, Airbus Defence and Space received the Excellence Award from ESA for their work onJuice.By 2023, the mission was estimated to costESA1.5 billion euros ($1.6 billion). The mainspacecraft designdrivers are related to the large distance to the Sun, the use ofsolar power, and Jupiter's harsh radiation environment. The orbit insertions at Jupiter and Ganymede and the large number of flyby manoeuvres (more than 25gravity assists, and two Europa flybys) require the spacecraft to carry about 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) of chemical propellant.The totaldelta-Vcapability of the spacecraft is about 2,700 m/s (6,000 mph). Juicehas a fixed 2.5 meter diameter high-gain antenna and a steerable medium-gain antenna; bothX-andK-bandwill be used. Downlink rates of 2 Gb/day are possible with ground-based Deep Space Antennas. On-board data storage capability is 1.25 Tb. TheJuicemain engine is ahypergolicbi-propellant (mono-methyl hydrazineandmixed oxides of nitrogen) 425 N thruster. A 100 kg multilayer insulation provides thermal control. The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized usingmomentum wheels. Radiation shielding is used to protect onboard electronics from the Jovian environment(the required radiation tolerance is 50kiloradat equipment level). TheJuicescience payload has a mass of 280 kilograms (620 lb) and includes the JANUS camera system, the MAJIS visible and infrared imaging spectrometer, the UVS ultraviolet imaging spectrograph, RIME radar sounder, GALA laser altimeter, SWI submillimetre wave instrument, J-MAG magnetometer, PEP particle and plasma package, RPWI radio and plasma wave investigation, 3GM radio science package, the PRIDE radio science instrument, and the RADEM radiation monitor. A 10.6 meters (35 ft) deployable boom will hold J-MAG and RPWI, a 16 meters (52 ft) long deployable antenna will be used for RIME. Four 3 meters (9.8 ft) booms carry parts of the RPWI instrument. The other instruments are mounted on the spacecraft body, or for 3GM, within thespacecraft bus. Juicewas launched into space on 14 April 2023 from theGuiana Space Centreon anAriane5rocket. This was the final launch of an ESA science mission using the Ariane 5 vehicle,and thesecond to last launch of the rocketoverall. The launch was originally scheduled for 13 April 2023, but due to poor weather the launch was postponed.The next day a second launch attempt succeeded, with liftoff occurring at 12:14:36 UTC. After the spacecraft separated from the rocket, it established a successful radio signal connection with the ground at 13:04 UTC.Juice's solar arrays were deployed about half an hour later, prompting ESA to deem the launch a success. During post-launch commissioning of the spacecraft, the RIME antenna failed to properly deploy from its mounting bracket.After several weeks of attempts to free the instrument, it was successfully deployed on 12 May of the same year. In August 2024,Juiceperformed its firstgravity assistwhen it flew by theMoonand thenEarth, becoming the first ever spacecraft to perform such maneuver using both bodies. The closest approach to the Moon happened at 21:15 UTC on 19 August. This increased the spacecraft's speed by 0.9 km/s relative to the Sun, sending it towards Earth. The closest approach to Earth happened at 21:56 UTC on 20 August. This reduced the spacecraft's speed by 4.8 km/s relative to the Sun, sending it towardsVenusfor the next gravity assist planned for August 2025. This double gravity assist saved the spacecraft up to 150 kg of fuel and deflected it by an angle of 100° compared to its path before the flyby. During this maneuver,Juicetested many of its scientific instruments. All 10 instruments were active during the Moon flyby, and eight during the Earth flyby. The JANUS camera took high-resolution images of the Moon and Earth.The MAJIS and SWI instruments detected the expected chemical signatures ofhabitabilityon Earth and MAJIS also provided information-rich temperature maps of Earth.Two sensors of the Particle Environment Package (PEP) took pictures andin situmeasurements of the charged particle cloud surrounding Earth.The RIMEradarsounder captured a radargram image of the patch of the lunar surface that is also visible in the famousEarthrisephoto, taken in 1968 during theApollo 8mission. On 16 July 2025, during a time-sensitive period before the plannedVenusflyby,Juiceexperienced a communication anomaly that temporarily severed the spacecraft's contact with Earth. After almost 20 hours of recovery efforts,ESOCandAirbusmanaged to resolve the issue and identified its root cause related to a scheduled restart of the spacecraft's internal timer. Plans for the flyby remained unchangedandJuicesuccessfully flew by Venus on 31 August 2025, with the closest approach of 5088 km above Venus's surface at 05:28 UTC, performing agravity assistmaneuver that increased its velocity by 5.1 km/s and sent it towards its second Earth flyby planned for September 2026. Due to thermal constraints (solar fluxof 3000 W/m2near Venus versus 50 W/m2nearJupiter), no imaging or scientific observations were planned for the Venus flyby and the spacecraft used its high-gain antenna as a thermal shield, pointing it toward the Sun. The interstellar comet3I/ATLAS, discovered in July 2025 as only the third knowninterstellar objectin theSolar System, is expected to make its closest approach to the Sun in October 2025. However, this part of its trajectory, when it is expected to show strong cometary activity, will not be visible from Earth-based telescopes as it occurs on the other side of the Sun. As of September 2025,ESAexpected that of all its interplanetary spacecraft,Juicewill have the best conditions for observing the object during its close approach to the Sun.Juicewill attempt to observe 3I/ATLAS in November 2025, at a distance of 0.428AU,using its cameras, spectrometers, and a particle sensor. ESA was also considering coordinating ultraviolet spectrograph observations with NASA'sEuropa Clipper. Due to the challenging thermal conditions duringJuice's travel through the inner Solar System, the data from these observations are not expected to reach Earth before February 2026.The commands for the observations were prepared atESOCon 24 October 2025. Following the launch, multiplegravity assistsare needed to putJuiceon a trajectory to Jupiter: Juicepasses through theasteroid belttwice. A flyby of the asteroid(223) Rosawas proposed to occur in October 2029, but was abandoned to save fuel for the primary Jovian mission. Gravity assists within the Jovian system include: The main characteristics of the Jupiter reference tour are summarised below (source: Table 5-2 of ESA/SRE(2014)1). This scenario assumed an early June 2022 launch, however, thedelta-Vrequirements are representative due to the rather short, repetitive orbital configurations of Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. When it arrives in the Jovian system in July 2031,Juicewill first perform a 400 km (250 mi) Ganymede gravity assist flyby to reduce spacecraft velocity by ~300 m/s (670 mph), followed by ~900 m/s (2,000 mph) Jupiter orbit insertion engine burn ~7.5 hours later. Finally, a Perijove Raising Manoeuvre (PRM) burn atapoapsiswill raise theperiapsisofJuice's initial 13x243 Jovian radii elongated orbit to match that of Ganymede (15 Rj). TheJuiceorbiter will perform detailed investigations onGanymedeand evaluate itspotential to support life. Investigations ofEuropaandCallistowill complete a comparative picture of theseGalilean moons.The three moons are thought to harbour internalliquid water oceans, and so are central to understanding thehabitabilityof icy worlds. The main science objectives for Ganymede, and to a lesser extent for Callisto, are: ForEuropa, the focus is on the chemistry essential to life, includingorganic molecules, and on understanding the formation of surface features and the composition of the non-water-ice material. The chemical investigations will be focused also on the question which chemicals originated underground and were brought to the surface bytectonicsorcryovolcanism, and which arrived from above, originating at other places within the Jovian system. Furthermore,Juicewill provide the first subsurface sounding of the moon, including the first determination of the minimal thickness of the icy crust over the most recently volcanically active regions.Juicewill be able to determine if pockets of liquid water exist within the ice and possibly also probe the interface between the icy shell and the subsurface ocean. More distant spatially resolved observations will also be carried out for several minor irregular satellites and the volcanically active moonIo.Juicewill monitor the volcanic activity of Io and study the composition of its surface materials. The mission will also observeJupiter's dusty ringsand study their interactions with the small irregular moons likeMetis,Adrastea,Amalthea, andThebe. Juicewill repeatedly mapJupiter's atmosphereand use its instruments to explore the poorly understood middle and upper atmosphere, focusing on the processes connecting the various layers and measuring, for the first time, the winds in Jupiter's middle atmosphere. This will expand our knowledge about the transport of energy between various regions of the atmosphere and illuminate the processes behind the longevity of theGreat Red Spotand other weather systems.Juicewill also explore themagnetosphere of Jupiterin great detail and focus on its interactions with theGalilean moons, especially the processes transporting plasma fromIoto the icy moons. On 21 February 2013, after a competition, 10 science instruments (plus one experiment using the spacecraft's telecommunication system) were selected by ESA, which were developed by science and engineering teams from all over Europe, with participation from the US.Japan also contributed several components for SWI, RPWI, GALA, PEP, JANUS, and J-MAG instruments, and will facilitate testing. The name isLatinfor "comprehensive observation of Jupiter, his love affairs and descendants."It is a camera system to image Ganymede and interesting parts of the surface of Callisto at better than 400 m/pixel (resolution limited by mission data volume). Selected targets will be investigated in high-resolution with a spatial resolution from 25 m/pixel down to 2.4 m/pixel with a 1.3° field of view. The camera system has 13 panchromatic, broad and narrow-band filters in the 0.36 μm to 1.1 μm range, and provides stereo imaging capabilities. JANUS will also allow relating spectral, laser, and radar measurements to geomorphology and thus will provide the overall geological context. A visible and infraredimaging spectrographoperating from 0.5 μm to 5.56 μm, withspectral resolutionof 3–7 nm, that will observe tropospheric cloud features and minor gas species on Jupiter and will investigate the composition of ices and minerals on the surfaces of the icy moons. The spatial resolution will be down to 75 m (246 ft) on Ganymede and about 100 km (62 mi) on Jupiter. Animaging spectrographoperating in the wavelength range 55–210 nm with spectral resolution of <0.6 nm that will characteriseexospheresandauroraeof the icy moons, including plume searches on Europa, and study the Jovian upper atmosphere and aurorae.

Aspectrometerusing a 30 cm (12 in) antenna and working in 1080–1275GHzand 530–601 GHz with spectral resolving power of ~107that will study Jupiter's stratosphere and troposphere, and the exospheres and surfaces of the icy moons. Alaser altimeterwith a 20 m (66 ft) spot size and 10 cm (3.9 in) vertical resolution at 200 km (120 mi) intended for studying topography of icy moons and tidal deformations of Ganymede. Anice-penetrating radarworking at frequency of 9 MHz (1 and 3 MHz bandwidth) emitted by a 16 m (52 ft) antenna; will be used to study the subsurface structure of Jovian moons down to 9 km (5.6 mi) depth with vertical resolution up to 30 m (98 ft) in ice. Juicewill study the subsurface oceans of the icy moons and the interaction of Jovian magnetic field with themagnetic field of Ganymedeusing a sensitivemagnetometer. A suite of six sensors to study themagnetosphere of Jupiterand its interactions with the Jovian moons. PEP will measure positive and negative ions, electrons, exospheric neutral gas, thermalplasmaandenergetic neutral atomspresent in all domains of the Jupiter system from 1meVto 1MeVenergy. RPWI will characterise theplasmaenvironment and radio emissions around the spacecraft, it is composed of four experiments: GANDALF, MIME, FRODO, and JENRAGE. RPWI will use fourLangmuir probes, each one mounted at the end of its own dedicated boom and sensitive up to 1.6 MHz, to characterize plasma, and receivers in the frequency range 80 kHz to 45 MHz to measure radio emissions.This scientific instrument is somewhat notable for usingSonic the Hedgehogas part of its logo. 3GM is a radio science package comprising aKatransponder and an ultrastableoscillator.3GM will be used to study the gravity field at Ganymede (up to 10 degrees), to determine the extent of internal oceans on the icy moons, and to investigate the structure of the neutral atmospheres and ionospheres of Jupiter (0.1 – 800 mbar) and its moons. 3GM carries an Israeli-builtatomic clock"that will measure tiny vacillations in a radio beam". The experiment will generate specific signals transmitted byJuice's antenna and received byvery-long-baseline interferometryto perform precision measurements of the gravity fields of Jupiter and its icy moons.

TheSolar Orbiter(SolO)is aSun-observingprobedeveloped by theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) with aNational Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) contribution. Solar Orbiter, designed to obtain detailed measurements of the innerheliosphereand the nascentsolar wind, also performs close observations of the polar regions of the Sun which is difficult to do from Earth. These observations are important in investigating how the Sun creates and controls its heliosphere. SolO makes observations of the Sun from an eccentric orbit moving as close as ≈60solar radii (RS), or 0.284astronomical units(au), placing it insideMercury'sperihelionof 0.3075 au.During the mission the orbital inclination will be raised to about 24°. The total mission cost is US$1.5 billion, counting both ESA and NASA contributions.SolO was launched on 10 February 2020 from Cape Canaveral, Florida (USA). The nominal mission is planned until the end of 2026, with a potential extension until 2030. During the initial cruise phase, which lasted until November 2021, Solar Orbiter performed two gravity-assist manoeuvres around Venus and one around Earth to alter the spacecraft's trajectory, guiding it towards the innermost regions of the Solar System. At the same time, Solar Orbiter acquired in situ data to characterise and calibrate its remote-sensing instruments. The first close solar pass took place on 26 March 2022 at around a third of Earth's distance from the Sun. The spacecraft's orbit has been chosen to be 'in resonance' with Venus, which means that it will return to the planet's vicinity every few orbits and can again use the planet's gravity to alter or tilt its orbit. Initially, Solar Orbiter will be confined to the same plane as the planets, but each encounter of Venus will increase its orbital inclination. For example, following the 2025 Venus encounter it makes solar passes at 17° inclination, increasing to 33° during a proposed mission extension phase, bringing even more of the polar regions into direct view. The Solar Orbiter spacecraft is a Sun-pointed, three-axis stabilised platform with a dedicated heat shield to provide protection from the high levels of solar flux near perihelion. The spacecraft provides a stable platform to accommodate the combination of remote-sensing and in-situ instrumentation in an electromagnetically clean environment. The 21 sensors were configured on the spacecraft to allow each to conduct its in-situ or remote-sensing experiments with both access to and protection from the solar environment. Solar Orbiter has inherited technology from previous missions, such as the solar arrays from theBepiColomboMercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO). Thesolar arrayscan be rotated about their longitudinal axis to avoid overheating when close to the Sun. A battery pack provides supplementary power at other points in the mission such as eclipse periods encountered during planetary flybys. The Telemetry, Tracking and Command Subsystem provides the communication link capability with the Earth inX-band. The subsystem supports telemetry, telecommand and ranging. Low-gain antennas are used for Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) and function as a back-up during the mission phase when steerable medium- and high-gain antennas are in use. The High-Temperature High-Gain Antenna needs to point to a wide range of positions to achieve a link with the ground station and to be able to downlink sufficient volumes of data. Its design was adapted from theBepiColombomission. The antenna can be folded in to gain protection from Solar Orbiter's heat shield if necessary. Most data will therefore initially be stored in on-board memory and sent back to Earth at the earliest possible opportunity.[citation needed] During nominal science operations, science data is downlinked for eight hours during each communication period with the ground station. Additional eight-hour downlink passes are scheduled as needed to reach the required total science data return of the mission. The Solar Orbiter ground segment makes maximum reuse of ESA's infrastructure for Deep Space missions: The Science Operations Centre was responsible for mission planning and the generation of payload operations requests to the MOC, as well as science data archiving. The SOC has been operational for the active science phase of the mission, i.e. from the beginning of the Cruise Phase onwards. The handover of payload operations from the MOC to the SOC is performed at the end of the Near-Earth Commissioning Phase (NECP). ESA'sMalargüe Stationin Argentina will be used for all operations throughout the mission, with the ground stations ofNew Norcia Station, Australia, andCebreros Station, Spain, acting as backup when necessary. The spacecraft makes a close approach to theSunevery six months.The closest approach will be positioned to allow a repeated study of the same region of the solar atmosphere.Solar Orbiterwill be able to observe the magnetic activity building up in the atmosphere that can lead to powerfulsolar flaresor eruptions.[citation needed] Researchers also have the chance to coordinate observations with NASA'sParker Solar Probemission (2018–present) which is performing measurements of the Sun's extendedcorona, as well as other ground-based assets such as theDaniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope.[citation needed] The objective of the mission is to perform close-up, high-resolution studies of the Sun and its innerheliosphere. The new understanding will help answer these questions: Since the launch of the mission, a series of papers have been released in three special issues of theAstronomy and AstrophysicsJournal: Meanwhile, regular "science nuggetsArchived3 August 2023 at theWayback Machine" are released on theSolar Orbiter science community websiteArchived3 August 2023 at theWayback Machine. The science payload is composed of 10 instruments: The following institutions operate each instrument: The €319 million contract to build orbiter was awarded toAstrium UKin April 2012The spacecraft's solar shield completed 2 week bake test in June 2014In April 2015, the launch was set back from July 2017 to October 2018.In August 2017, Solar Orbiter was considered "on track" for a launch in February 2019.The spacecraft is shipped toIABGin Germany to begin the environmental test campaign in September 2018. TheAtlas V411 (AV-087) lifted off fromSLC-41at Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 04:03 UTC. The Solar Orbiter spacecraft separated from theCentaur upper stagenearly 53 minutes later, and ESA acquired the first signals from the spacecraft a few minutes later. After launch, Solar Orbiter entered the crusie phase, which lasted until late 2021.Using repeatedgravity assistsfrom Earth and Venus, the spacecraft reached its operational orbit, an elliptical orbit with perihelion 0.29 AU and aphelion 0.91 AU. The first flyby was of Venus in December 2020. In June 2020, Solar Orbiter came within 77,000,000 km (48,000,000 mi) of the Sun, and captured the closest pictures of the Sun ever taken. During its cruise towards Venus, Solar Orbiter passed through theion tailof cometC/2019 Y4 (ATLAS)from 31 May to 1 June 2020. It passed through the comet'sdust tailon 6 June 2020.In December 2021, it flew through tail of cometC/2021 A1 Leonard. Over the expected mission duration of 7 years, Solar Orbiter will use additionalgravity assistsfromVenusto raise its inclination from 0° to 24°, allowing it a better view of the Sun's poles. If an extended mission is approved, the inclination could rise further to 33°. The highest resolution image of the Sun’s full disc and outer atmosphere, the corona, so far have been taken on 7 March 2022.In September 2022, scientists suggested a solution to themagnetic switchbackmystery based on Solar Orbiter data from March 2022. In February 2025, Solar Orbiter left theorbital planeof thesolar systemafter successfully completing the 4thVenusflyby,tilting its orbit to 17°. On 11 June 2025, the mission's first images and videos of the Sun’s south pole (taken in March 2025) were released. These are the first images of the Sun’s poles taken from outside the ecliptic plane. In September 2025, scientists publishedCoSEE-Cat: A Comprehensive Solar Energetic Electron event Catalogueand identified two distinct types of solar energeticelectrons, one associated with intensesolar flaresand other withcoronal mass ejections, usingin situdata from Solar Orbiter. SolO and NASA'sParker Solar Probe(PSP) missions cooperated to trace solar wind and transients from their sources on the Sun to the inner interplanetary space. In 2022, SolO and PSP planners collaborated to study why the Sun's atmosphere is "150 times hotter" than its surface. SolO observed the Sun from 140 million kilometers, while PSP simultaneously observed the Sun's corona from nearly 9 million kilometers. In March 2024, both space probes were at their closest approaches to the Sun, PSP at 7.3 million km, and SolO at 45 million km. SolO observed the Sun, while PSP sampled the plasma of the solar wind, allowing scientists to compare data from both probes. Solar Orbiter and theDaniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope(DKIST) are two of the facilities available to the solar physics community, providing observations with the highest spatial resolution from space and ground, respectively. The first coordinated observations of the Sun by these two facilities occurred between 18 and 24 October 2022. The aim of these initial coordinated observations was to demonstrate how such high-resolution, joint observations—along with similar campaigns—can help address important scientific questions in the field. Coordinated data were successfully collected at several times throughout the week, enabling studies ofcoronal loopphysics, the formation and evolution of small-scaleactive regionbrightenings, andcoronal raindynamics.

CHEOPS(CHaracterisingExOPlanetsSatellite) is a Europeanspace telescope. Its objective is to determine the size of knownextrasolar planets, which will allow the estimation of their mass, density, composition and their formation. Launched on 18 December 2019, it is the first Small-class mission in ESA'sCosmic Visionscience programme. The small satellite features an opticalRitchey–Chrétien telescopewith an aperture of 30 cm, mounted on a standard small satellite platform. It was placed into aSun-synchronous orbitof about 700 km altitude. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered by the end of the 2010s;some haveminimum massmeasurements from theradial velocity methodwhile others that are seen totransittheir parent stars have measures of their physical size. Few exoplanets to date have highly accurate measures for both mass and radius, limiting the ability to study the variety inbulk densitythat would provide clues as to what materials they are made of and their formation history. For the planned mission duration of 3.5 years, CHEOPS is to measure the size of knowntransitingexoplanets orbiting bright and nearby stars,as well as search for predicted transits of exoplanets previously discovered via radial velocity. Scientists behind the project expect these well-characterised transiting exoplanets to be prime targets for observatories such asJames Webb Space Telescope(JWST) or theextremely large telescopes. In 2023, the mission was extended to 2026. During the extended mission CHEOPS is expected to also search for exomoons. Organized as a partnership between theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) and theSwiss Space Office, CHEOPS was selected in October 2012 from among 26 proposals as the firstS-class("small") space mission in ESA'sCosmic Visionprogramme.ESA is the mission architect and responsible for the spacecraft and launch opportunity procurement. The project is led by the Center for Space and Habitability at theUniversity of Bern, Switzerland, with contributions from other Swiss and European universities. The principal investigator for the science instrument is Willy Benz at the University of Bern and the principal scientist fromESAisKate Isaak. After a competition phase,Airbus Defence and Spacein Spain was selected as the spacecraft builder.The ESA mission cost is capped at €50 million.Media Lario S.r.l. (Italy) was responsible for the optical finishing of the primary optical element. CHEOPS launched on board of aSoyuz-STAlaunch vehicleon 18 December 2019, at 08:54:20UTCfromCentre Spatial Guyanais(CSG) inKourou, French Guiana.CHEOPS separated after two hours and 23 minutes from lift-off.The primary payload was the first satellite ofASI'sCOSMO-SkyMedSecond Generation constellation, CSG 1. The launcher also deployed threeCubeSats, including ESA'sOPS-SAT.CHEOPS went into a 712 km (442 mi) altitudeSun-synchronous polar orbit. After the cover of the telescope was opened on 29 January 2020,CHEOPS took itsfirst lightimage on 7 February 2020. The image is centred on the starHD 70843, a yellow-white star located around 150 light years away. The star was selected because of its brightness and position on the sky. The stars in the image are blurry, which is intended. The defocused mirror distributes the light of the star over many pixels of the detector, making the measurements of starlight more precise.The first light images were better than it was expected from tests in the laboratory. The images were smoother and more symmetrical, which could reducenoisecaused by the detector and the spacecraft. In April 2020, the telescope beganscience operations. The satellite has dimensions of approximately 1.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in × 4 ft 11 in × 4 ft 11 in) and a hexagonal base structure. Thesatellite busof the CHEOPS spacecraft is based on theSEOSATplatform. Asunshieldmounted on the platform protects the radiator and detector housing against the Sun, and it also featuressolar panelsfor the electrical power subsystem. The sunshield wraps around the hexagonal bus. The control system is3-axis stabilized, butnadirlocked, ensuring that one of the spacecraft axes is always pointing towards the Earth. During each orbit, the spacecraft will slowly rotate around the telescope line-of-sight to keep the focal plane radiator oriented towards cold space, enabling passive cooling of the detector. The typical observation duration will be 48 hours. During a typical 48-hour observation CHEOPS will have a pointing stability of better than eight arcsec at 95% confidence. The detector, support electronics, telescope, back-end optics, instrument computer, and thermal regulation hardware are known collectively as the CHEOPS Instrument System (CIS). The required photometric precision will be achieved using a single frame-transfer, back-illuminatedCharge-coupled device(CCD) detector fromTeledyne e2vwith 1024 × 1024 pixels and a pixel pitch of 13μm. The CCD is mounted in the focal plane of the telescope, and will be passively cooled to 233 K (−40 °C), with a thermal stability of 10 mK. The telescope is a single medium-size f/8, on-axisRitchey-Chrétien telescopewith a 32 cm (13 in) aperture, mounted on a stiffoptical bench.The University of Geneva and the University of Bern provided the powerfulphotometer.Target star images are deliberately defocussed to help accurate photometry. Twotitaniumplaques with thousands of miniaturised drawings by children have been fixed to CHEOPS. Each plaque measures nearly 18 × 24 cm (7.1 × 9.4 in). The plaques, prepared by a team at theBern University of Applied Scienceswere unveiled in a dedicated ceremony atRUAGon 27 August 2018.The individual drawings can be found at the website of CHEOPS by clicking on a map of Europe. The main goal of CHEOPS is the accurate measurement of the size (radii) of the exoplanets for which ground-basedspectroscopicsurveyshave already provided mass estimates. Knowing both the mass and the size of the exoplanets will allow scientists to determine the planets' density and thus their approximate composition, such as whether they are gaseous orrocky. CHEOPS is the most efficient instrument to search for shallow transits and to determine accurate radii for known exoplanets in thesuper-Earthto Neptune mass range (1–6 Earth radius). CHEOPS measuresphotometricsignals with a precision limited by stellar photon noise of 150ppm/min for a 9thmagnitudestar. This corresponds to the transit of an Earth-sized planet orbiting a star of 0.9R☉in 60 days detected with a S/Ntransit>10 (100 ppm transit depth). For example, an Earth-size transit across a G star creates an 80 ppm depth. The different science objectives require 500 separate target pointings. Assuming 1 hour per pointing the mission duration is estimated at 1175 days or 3.2 years. Together with the 20% of open time available for the community the total duration of the CHEOPS mission is estimated to be 3.5 years. The spacecraft is powered bysolar panelsthat are also part of itssunshield. They provide 60 W continuous power for instrument operations and allow for at least a 1.2gigabit/day data downlink capacity.Data-taking started in early 2020. Eighty per cent of the science observing time on CHEOPS is dedicated to the CHEOPS Guaranteed Time Observing (GTO) Programme, under the responsibility of the CHEOPS Science Team (chaired byDidier Queloz).The majority of the GTO programme involves the characterization of known transiting exoplanets and improvement of known parameters. Part of the GTO programme is to find transits of known exoplanets that were confirmed by other techniques, such asradial-velocity, but not by the transit-method. Another part of the GTO programme includes exploration of multi-systems and search of additional planets in those systems, for example using thetransit-timing-variation(TTV) method. The other 20% of the science observing time on CHEOPS is made available to the scientific community in the form of an ESA-run Guest Observers' (GO) Programme. Researchers can submit proposals for observations with CHEOPS through an annual Announcements of Opportunity (AO) Program.The approved AO-1 projects include observations of theHot JupitersHD 17156 b,Kelt-22A b,warm jupiterK2-139b,multi systemsGJ 9827,K2-138, the exoplanetDS Tuc Ab,55 Cancri e(likely GTO),WASP-189 band other exoplanet science related observations, such as planets around rapidly-rotating stars, planet material aroundwhite dwarfsand searching for transitingexocometsaround5 Vulpeculae. HD 108236f was discovered with CHEOPS. A study ofWASP-189b(a 'hot Jupiter') has been published. TOI-178has been found to have 6 planets, 5 having orbital resonances.Planetary densities have been calculated. CHEOPS, supplemented by TESS data, characterizedAU Micand its planet b. It also confirmedtransit-timing variations, caused by the outer planets. TOI-561is a multi-planet system that was studied with CHEOPS,HARPS-N and TESS. The study confirmed that TOI-561 b is the lowest densityultra-short period planet. CHEOPS observedoccultationscaused by the planet55 Cancri eand was able to observe individual occultations for the first time. A study searching for transits around 6white dwarfsdid not detect any transitsand a study to search forexomoonsaroundv2Lupi dwas unable to detect any additional transits. The full transit of v2Lupi d was observed for the first time with CHEOPS, potentially aiding any future searches for exomoons around this planet. CHEOPS also sees trails from other satellites during its observations, since it is inlow Earth orbit.

Gaiawas aspace observatoryof theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) that was launched in 2013 and operated until March 2025. The spacecraft was designed forastrometry: measuring the positions, distances and motions of stars with unprecedented precision,and the positions of exoplanets by measuring attributes about the stars they orbit such as theirapparent magnitudeandcolor.As of May 2025[update], the mission data processing continues, aiming to construct the largest and most precise 3D space catalog ever made, totalling approximately 1 billionastronomical objects, mainly stars, but also planets, comets, asteroids andquasars, among others. To study the precise position and motion of its target objects, the spacecraft monitored each of them about 70 timesover the five years of the nominal mission (2014–2019), and about as many during its extension.Due to its detectors degrading slower than initially expected, the mission was given an extension.As of March 2023, the spacecraft had enough micro-propulsion fuel to operate until the second quarter of 2025.Gaiatargeted objects brighter thanmagnitude20 in a broad photometric band that covered the extended visual range between near-UV and near infrared;such objects represent approximately 1% of the Milky Way population.Additionally,Gaiawas expected to detect thousands to tens of thousands of Jupiter-sizedexoplanetsbeyond the Solar System by using the astrometry method,500,000 quasars outside this galaxy and tens of thousands of known and new asteroids and comets within the Solar System. On March 27, 2025, scientists at the ESA switched off Gaia after more than a decade of service, sending it into orbit around the sun. TheGaiamission continues to create a precise three-dimensional map of astronomical objects throughout the Milky Way and map their motions, which encode the origin and subsequent evolution of the Milky Way. Thespectrophotometricmeasurements provide detailed physical properties of all stars observed, characterizing theirluminosity,effective temperature,gravityandelementalcomposition. This massive stellar census is providing the basic observational data to analyze a wide range of important questions related to the origin, structure and evolutionary history of the Milky Way galaxy. The successor to theHipparcosmission (operational 1989–1993),Gaiais part of ESA'sHorizon 2000+long-term scientific program.Gaiawas launched on 19 December 2013 byArianespaceusing aSoyuz ST-B/Fregat-MTrocket flying fromKourouin French Guiana.The spacecraft currently operates in aLissajous orbitaround theSun–EarthL2Lagrangian point. The science observation officially ended on 15 January 2025. TheGaiaspace telescope had its roots in ESA'sHipparcosmission (1989–1993). Its mission was proposed in October 1993 byLennart Lindegren(Lund Observatory,Lund University, Sweden) andMichael Perryman(ESA) in response to a call for proposals for ESA's Horizon Plus long-term scientific programme. It was adopted by ESA's Science Programme Committee as cornerstone mission number 6 on 13 October 2000, and the B2 phase of the project was authorised on 9 February 2006, withEADS Astriumtaking responsibility for the hardware. The name "Gaia" was originally derived as an acronym forGlobal Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics. This reflected the optical technique ofinterferometrythat was originally planned for use on the spacecraft. While the working method evolved during studies and the acronym is no longer applicable, the nameGaiaremained to provide continuity with the project. The total cost of the mission is around €740 million (~ $1 billion), including the manufacture, launch and ground operations.Gaiawas completed two years behind schedule and 16% above its initial budget, mostly due to the difficulties encountered in polishingGaia'stensilicon carbidemirrors and assembling and testing the focal plane camera system. TheGaiaspace mission has the following objectives: Gaiawas launched byArianespace, using aSoyuz ST-Brocket with aFregat-MTupper stage, from theEnsemble de Lancement SoyouzatKourouinFrench Guianaon 19 December 2013 at 09:12 UTC (06:12 local time). The satellite separated from the rocket's upper stage 43 minutes after launch at 09:54 UTC. The craft headed towards the Sun–EarthLagrange point L2located approximately 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, arriving there 8 January 2014.The L2 point provides the spacecraft with a very stable gravitational and thermal environment. There, it uses aLissajous orbitthat avoids blockage of the Sun by the Earth, which would limit the amount of solar energy the satellite could produce through itssolar panels, as well as disturb the spacecraft's thermal equilibrium. After launch, a 10-metre-diameter sunshade was deployed. The sunshade always maintains a fixed 45 degree angle to the Sun, while precessing to scan the sky, thus keeping all telescope components cool and poweringGaiausing solar panels on its surface. These factors and the materials used in its creation allowGaiato function in conditions between -170°C and 70°C. TheGaiapayload consists of three main instruments: In order to maintain the fine pointing to focus on stars many light years away, the only moving parts are actuators to align the mirrors and the valves to fire the thrusters. It has no reaction wheels or gyroscopes. The spacecraft subsystems are mounted on a rigidsilicon carbideframe, which provides a stable structure that will not expand or contract due to temperature. Attitude control is provided by smallcold gas thrustersthat can output 1.5 micrograms of nitrogen per second. The telemetric link with the satellite is about 3Mbit/son average, while the total content of the focal plane represents severalGbit/s.Therefore, only a few dozen pixels around each object can be downlinked. The design of theGaiafocal plane and instruments. Due to the spacecraft's rotation, images cross the focal plane array right-to-left at 60 arcseconds per second. Similar to its predecessorHipparcos, but with a precision one hundred times greater,Gaiaconsists of two telescopes providing two observing directions with a fixed, wide angle of 106.5° between them.The spacecraft rotates continuously around an axis perpendicular to the two telescopes' lines of sight, with a spin period of 6 hours. Thus, every 6 hours the spacecraft scans a great circle stripe approximately 0.7 degrees wide. The spin axis in turn has a slowerprecessionacross the sky: it maintains a fixed 45 degree angle to the Sun, but follows a cone around the Sun every 63 days, giving a cycloid-like path relative to the stars.  Over the course of the mission, each star is scanned many times at various scan directions, providing interlocking measurements over the full sky. The two key telescope properties are: Each celestial object was observed on average about 70 times during the five years of the nominal mission, which has been extended to approximately ten years and will thus obtain twice as many observations.These measurements will help determine the astrometric parameters of stars: two corresponding to the angular position of a given star on the sky, two for the derivatives of the star's position over time (motion) and lastly, the star'sparallaxfrom which distance can be calculated. The radial velocity of the brighter stars is measured by an integratedspectrometerobserving theDoppler effect. Because of the physical constraints imposed by the Soyuz spacecraft,Gaia'sfocal arrays could not be equipped with optimal radiation shielding, and ESA expected their performance to suffer somewhat toward the end of the initial five-year mission. Ground tests of the CCDs while they were subjected to radiation provided reassurance that the primary mission's objectives can be met. An atomic clock on boardGaiaplays a crucial role in achieving the mission's primary objectives.Gaiarotates with angular velocity of 60"/sec or 0.6 microarcseconds in 10 nanoseconds. Therefore, in order to meet its positioning goals,Gaiamust be able to record the exact time of observation to within nanoseconds. Furthermore, no systematic positioning errors over the rotational period of 6 hours should be introduced by the clock performance. For the timing error to be below 10 nanoseconds over each rotational period, the frequency stability of the on-board clock needs to be better than 10−12. The rubidium atomic clock aboard theGaiaspacecraft has a stability reaching ~ 10−13over each rotational period of 21600 seconds. Gaia's measurements contribute to the creation and maintenance of a high-precision celestial reference frame, theBarycentric Celestial Reference System (BCRS), which is essential for both astronomy and navigation. This reference frame serves as a fundamental grid for positioning celestial objects in the sky, aiding astronomers in various research endeavors. All observations, regardless of the actual positioning of the spacecraft, must be expressed in terms of this reference system. As a fully relativistic model, the influence of the gravitational field of the solar-system must be taken into account, including such factors as the gravitational light-bending due to the Sun, the major planets and the Moon. The expected accuracies of the final catalogue data have been calculated following in-orbit testing, taking into account the issues of stray light, degradation of the optics, and the basic angle instability. The best accuracies for parallax, position and proper motion are obtained for the brighter observed stars, apparent magnitudes 3–12. The standard deviation for these stars is expected to be 6.7 micro-arcseconds or better. For fainter stars, error levels increase, reaching 26.6 micro-arcseconds error in the parallax for 15th-magnitude stars, and several hundred micro-arcseconds for 20th-magnitude stars.For comparison, the best parallax error levels from the new Hipparcos reduction are no better than 100 micro-arcseconds, with typical levels several times larger. In October 2013ESAhad to postponeGaia'soriginal launch date, due to a precautionary replacement of two ofGaia'stransponders. These are used to generate timing signals for the downlink of science data. A problem with an identical transponder on a satellite already in orbit motivated their replacement and reverification once incorporated intoGaia. The rescheduled launch window was from 17 December 2013 to 5 January 2014, withGaiaslated for launch on 19 December. Gaiawas successfully launched on 19 December 2013 at 09:12UTC.About three weeks after launch, on 8 January 2014, it reached its designated orbit around the Sun-EarthL2 Lagrange point(SEL2),about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. In 2015, thePan-STARRSobservatory discovered an object orbiting the Earth, which theMinor Planet Centercatalogued as object2015 HP116. It was soon found to be an accidental rediscovery of the Gaia spacecraft and the designation was promptly retracted. Shortly after launch, ESA revealed thatGaiasuffers from astray lightproblem. The problem was initially thought to be due to ice deposits reflecting some of the light diffracted around the edges of the sunshield into the telescope apertures and on towards the focal plane.The actual source of the stray light was later identified as the fibers of the sunshield, protruding beyond the edges of the shield.This results in a "degradation in science performance [which] will be relatively modest and mostly restricted to the faintest ofGaia'sone billion stars." Mitigation schemes were implementedto improve performance. The degradation is more severe for the RVS spectrograph than for the astrometry measurements, because it spreads the light of the star onto a much larger number of detector pixels, each of which collects scattered light. This kind of problem has some historical background. In 1985 onSTS-51-F, the Space ShuttleSpacelab-2 mission, another astronomical mission hampered by stray debris was theInfrared Telescope(IRT), in which a piece ofmylarinsulation broke loose and floated into the line-of-sight of the telescope causing corrupted data.The testing of stray-light and baffles is a noted part of space imaging instruments. In April 2024, amicrometeoroidhit and damaged Gaia's protective cover, creating "a little gap that allowed stray sunlight – around one billionth of the intensity of direct sunlight felt on Earth – to occasionally disruptGaia’s very sensitive sensors". In May, the electronics of one of the CCDs failed, which caused a high rate of false detections. After that, the engineers refocusedGaia's optics "for the final time". The testing and calibration phase, which started whileGaiawas en route to SEL2 point, continued until the end of July 2014,three months behind schedule due to unforeseen issues with stray light entering the detector. After the six-month commissioning period, the satellite started its nominal five-year period of scientific operations on 25 July 2014 using a special scanning mode that intensively scanned the region near theecliptic poles; on 21 August 2014Gaiabegan using its normal scanning mode which provides more uniform coverage. Although it was originally planned to limitGaia's observations to stars fainter than magnitude 5.7, tests carried out during the commissioning phase indicated thatGaiacould autonomously identify stars as bright as magnitude 3. WhenGaiaentered regular scientific operations in July 2014, it was configured to routinely process stars in the magnitude range 3 – 20.On the bright side of that limit, special operational procedures download raw scanning data for the remaining 230 stars brighter than magnitude 3; methods to reduce and analyse these data are being developed; and it is expected that there will be "complete sky coverage at the bright end" with standard errors of "a few dozen μas". On 30 August 2014,Gaiadiscovered its firstsupernovain another galaxy.On 3 July 2015, a map of the Milky Way by star density was released, based on data from the spacecraft.As of August 2016, "more than 50 billion focal plane transits, 110 billion photometric observations and 9.4 billion spectroscopic observations have been successfully processed." In 2018 theGaiamission was extended to 2020, and in 2020 it was further extended through 2022, with an additional "indicative extension" extending through 2025.The limiting factor to further mission extensions is the supply of nitrogen for the cold gas thrusters of the micro-propulsion system.The amount ofdinitrogen tetroxide(NTO) andmonomethylhydrazine(MMH) for the chemical propulsion subsystem on board might have beeen enough to stabilize the spacecraft at L2 for several decades. Without the cold gas, though, the space craft could no longer be pointed on a microarcsecond scale. In March 2023, theGaiamission was extended through the second quarter of 2025, when the spacecraft was expected to run out of cold gas propellant. Gaia's last targeted observation was done on 10 January 2025.After several weeks of onboard technology tests,Gaialeft its orbit nearL2and was put into aheliocentric orbitaway from Earth'ssphere of influence.After downlinking all remaining data to Earth,Gaiawas decommissioned andpassivatedon 27 March 2025.The mission has since entered a post-operations phase to complete and publish the final Gaia Data Release, DR5, by the end of 2030. SeveralGaia cataloguesare released over the years each time with increasing amounts of information and better astrometry; the early releases also miss some stars, especially fainter stars located in dense star fields and members of close binary pairs.The first data release, Gaia DR1, based on 14 months of observation was on 14 September 2016.The data release includes "positions and ... magnitudes for 1.1 billion stars using onlyGaiadata; positions, parallaxes and proper motions for more than 2 million stars" based on a combination ofGaiaandTycho-2data for those objects in both catalogues; "light curves and characteristics for about 3,000 variable stars; and positions and magnitudes for more than 2000 ... extragalactic sources used to define thecelestial reference frame". The second data release (DR2), which occurred on 25 April 2018,is based on 22 months of observations made between 25 July 2014 and 23 May 2016. It includes positions, parallaxes and proper motions for about 1.3 billion stars and positions of an additional 300 million stars in the magnitude range g = 3–20,red and blue photometric data for about 1.1 billion stars and single colour photometry for an additional 400 million stars, and median radial velocities for about 7 million stars between magnitude 4 and 13. It also contains data for over 14,000 selected Solar System objects. Due to uncertainties in the data pipeline, the third data release, based on 34 months of observations, was split into two parts so that data that was ready first, was released first. The first part, EDR3 ("Early Data Release 3"), consisting of improved positions, parallaxes and proper motions, was released on 3 December 2020.The coordinates in EDR3 use a new version of theGaiacelestial reference frame (Gaia–CRF3), based on observations of 1,614,173 extragalactic sources,2,269 of which were common to radio sources in the third revision of theInternational Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3).Included is the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS), containing 331,312 stars within (nominally) 100 parsecs (330 light-years). The full DR3, published on 13 June 2022, includes the EDR3 data plus Solar System data; variability information; results for non-single stars, for quasars, and for extended objects; astrophysical parameters; and a special data set, the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey (GAPS). Between DR3 and DR4 there was a Focused Product Release, publishing among other things new data on theOmega Centauricluster using a novel observation technique; the technique will be extended to all globular clusters and other dense fields in future full Data Releases. The full data release for the five-year nominal mission, DR4, will include full astrometric, photometric and radial-velocity catalogues, variable-star and non-single-star solutions, source classifications plus multiple astrophysical parameters for stars, unresolved binaries, galaxies and quasars, an exo-planet list and epoch and transit data for all sources.Additional release(s) will take place depending on mission extensions.Most measurements in DR4 are expected to be 1.7 times more precise than DR2; proper motions will be 4.5 times more precise.DR4 is expected to be released no earlier than mid-2026. The final Gaia catalogue, DR5, will consist of all data collected during the lifespan of the mission. It will be 1.4 times more precise than DR4, while proper motions will be 2.8 times more precise than DR4.It will be published no earlier than the end of 2030.All data of all catalogues will be available in an online data base that is free to use. An outreach application,Gaia Sky, has been developed to explore the galaxy in three dimensions usingGaiadata. The overall data volume that was retrieved from the spacecraft during the nominal five-year mission at a compressed data rate of 1 Mbit/s is approximately 60TB, amounting to about 200 TB of usable uncompressed data on the ground, stored in anInterSystems Cachédatabase. The responsibility of the data processing, partly funded by ESA, is entrusted to a European consortium, theData Processing and Analysis Consortium(DPAC), which was selected after its proposal to the ESA Announcement of Opportunity released in November 2006. DPAC's funding is provided by the participating countries and has been secured until the production ofGaia'sfinal catalogue. Gaiasends back data for about eight hours every day at about 5 Mbit/s. ESA's three 35-metre-diameter radio dishes of theESTRACKnetwork inCebreros, Spain,Malargüe, Argentina andNew Norcia, Australia, receive the data. In July 2017, the Gaia–ESO Survey reported using Gaia data to find double-, triple-, and quadruple- stars. Using advanced techniques they identified 342 binary candidates, 11 triple candidates, and 1 quadruple candidate. Nine of these had been identified by other means, thus confirming that the technique can correctly identify multiple star systems.The possible quadruple star system isHD 74438, which was, in a paper published in 2022, identified as a possible progenitor of asub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae. In November 2017, scientists led byDavide Massariof theKapteyn Astronomical Institute,University of Groningen, Netherlands released a paperdescribing the characterization ofproper motion(3D) within theSculptor dwarf galaxy, and of that galaxy's trajectory through space and with respect to theMilky Way, using data fromGaiaand theHubble Space Telescope. Massari said, "With the precision achieved we can measure the yearly motion of a star on the sky which corresponds to less than the size of a pinhead on the Moon as seen from Earth." The data showed that Sculptor orbits the Milky Way in a highly elliptical orbit; it is currently near its closest approach at a distance of about 83.4 kiloparsecs (272,000 ly), but the orbit can take it out to around 222 kiloparsecs (720,000 ly) distant. In October 2018,Leiden Universityastronomers were able to determine the orbits of 20  hyperrunaway star candidates from the DR2 dataset. Expecting to find a single star exiting theMilky Way, they instead found seven. More surprisingly, the team found that 13 hyperrunaway stars were instead approaching the Milky Way, possibly originating from as-of-yet unknown extragalactic sources. Alternatively, they could be halo stars to this galaxy, and further spectroscopic studies will help determine which scenario is more likely.Independent measurements have demonstrated that the greatestGaiaradial velocity among the hyperrunaway stars is contaminated by light from nearby bright stars in a crowded field and cast doubt on the highGaiaradial velocities of other hypervelocity stars. In late October 2018, the galactic populationGaia-Enceladus, the remains of a major merger with the defunct Enceladus dwarf, was discovered.This system is associated with at least 13 globular clusters, and the creation of the Thick Disk of the Milky Way. It represents a significant merger about 10 billion years ago in the Milky Way Galaxy. In November 2018, the galaxyAntlia 2was discovered. It is similar in size to theLarge Magellanic Cloud, despite being 10,000 times fainter. Antlia 2 has the lowest surface brightness of any galaxy discovered. In December 2019 the star clusterPrice-Whelan 1was discovered.The cluster belongs to theMagellanic Cloudsand is located in the leading arm of theseDwarf Galaxies. The discovery suggests that the stream of gas extending from the Magellanic Clouds to the Milky Way is about half as far from the Milky Way as previously thought. TheRadcliffe wavewas discovered in data measured byGaia, published in January 2020. In November 2020, Gaia measured the acceleration of the solar system towards the galactic center as 0.23 nanometers/s2. In March 2021, the European Space Agency announced thatGaiahad identified a transiting exoplanet for the first time. The planet was discovered orbiting solar-type star Gaia EDR3 3026325426682637824. Following its initial discovery, the PEPSI spectrograph from theLarge Binocular Telescope(LBT) in Arizona was used to confirm the discovery and categorise it as a Jovian planet, a gas planet composed of hydrogen and helium gas.In May 2022, the confirmation of this exoplanet, designatedGaia-1b, was formally published, along with a second planet,Gaia-2b. Based on its data, Gaia'sHertzsprung–Russell diagram(HR diagram) is one of the most accurate ones ever produced of the Milky Way Galaxy. Analysis of Gaia DR3 data in 2022 revealed a Sun-like star with the identifier Gaia DR3 4373465352415301632 orbiting ablack hole, dubbedGaia BH1. At a distance of roughly 1,600 light-years (490 pc), it is the closest known black hole to Earth.Another system with ared giantorbiting a black hole,Gaia BH2, was also discovered. In September 2023,radial velocityobservations were used to confirm an exoplanet orbiting the starHIP 66074that was first detected in Gaia DR3astrometrydata. This planet, known as HIP 66074 b or Gaia-3b, is the third Gaia exoplanet discovery to be confirmed and the first such discovery made using astrometry.In addition, another exoplanet was discovered from agravitational microlensingevent observed by Gaia,Gaia22dkv. The host star is brighter than that of any exoplanet previously detected by microlensing, potentially making the planet detectable by radial velocity as well. In March 2024,Gaiadiscovered two streams of stars, named by researchers Shakti and Shiva, that formed more than 12 billion years ago. In 2025 a detailed 3D map of dust distribution within the Milky Way was constructed using data fromGaiaandLAMOSTspectral survey and machine learning. GaiaNIR (Gaia Near Infra-Red) is a proposed successor of Gaia in thenear-infrared.The mission would enlarge the current catalog with sources that are only (or better) visible in the near-infrared, at the cost of less precise measurements than an equivalent visible-light mission due to the broaderdiffractionpattern at longer wavelengths. It would at the same time improve the star parallax and particularly proper motion accuracy by revisiting the sources of the Gaia catalog.One of the main challenges in building GaiaNIR is the lowtechnology readiness levelof near-infraredtime delay and integrationdetectors but recent progress withAvalanche photodiodedetectors (APDs) is overcoming this. In a 2017 ESA report two alternative concepts using conventional near-infrared detectors and de-spin mirrors were proposed but even without the development of NIR TDI detectors the technological challenge will likely increase the cost over an ESA M-class mission and might need shared cost with other space agencies.One possible partnership with US institutions was proposed.Since then theEuropean Space Agency Science ProgrammeVoyage 2050 has selected the theme of "Galactic Ecosystem with Astrometry in the Near-infrared" as one of two potential L-class missions to be implemented in the coming years thus boosting the chances for GaiaNIR which proposes exactly this.
