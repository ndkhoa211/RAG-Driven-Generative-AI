            "Space explorationis the physical investigation ofouter spacebyuncrewed robotic space probesand throughhuman spaceflight. While the observation of objects in space, known asastronomy, predates reliablerecorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficientrocketsduring the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. The early era of space exploration was driven by a \"Space Race\" in which theSoviet Unionand theUnited Statesvied to demonstrate their technological superiority. Landmarks of this era include the launch of the first human-made object to orbitEarth, the Soviet Union'sSputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the firstMoon landingby the AmericanApollo 11mission on 20 July 1969. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the firsthuman spaceflight(Yuri GagarinaboardVostok 1) in 1961, the firstspacewalk(byAlexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, thefirst automatic landingon another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the firstspace station(Salyut 1) in 1971. In the 1970s, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as theSpace Shuttle program, and from competition to cooperation, the foremost example being theInternational Space Station(ISS), built between 1998 and 2011. The 2000s brought advancements in the national space-exploration programs ofChina, theEuropean Union,Japan, andIndia. The 2010s saw the rise of theprivate space industryin earnest with the development of private launch vehicles, space capsules, and satellite manufacturing. In the 2020s, the two primary global programs gaining traction are Moon-focused: the Chinese-ledInternational Lunar Research Stationand the U.S.-ledArtemis Program, with its plan to build theLunar Gatewayand theArtemis Base Camp, each with a set of international partners. The firsttelescopeis said to have been invented in 1608 in theNetherlandsby aneyeglassmaker namedHans Lippershey, but their first recorded use in astronomy was byGalileo Galileiin 1609.In 1668Isaac Newtonbuilthis ownreflecting telescope, the first fully functional telescope of this kind, and a landmark for future developments due to its superior features over the previousGalilean telescope. A string ofdiscoveries in the Solar System(and beyond) followed, then and in thenext centuries: themountains of the Moon, thephases of Venus,the main satellitesofJupiterandSaturn, therings of Saturn, manycomets, theasteroids, the new planetsUranusandNeptune, and many moresatellites. TheOrbiting Astronomical Observatory 2was the firstspace telescopelaunched 1968,but the launch of theHubble Space Telescopein 1990set a milestone. As of 1 December 2022, there were 5,284 confirmedexoplanetsdiscovered. TheMilky Wayis estimated to contain 100–400 billionstarsand more than 100 billionplanets.There are at least 2 trilliongalaxiesin theobservable universe.HD1is themost distantknown object from Earth, reported as 33.4 billionlight-yearsaway. MW 18014was a GermanV-2 rockettest launch that took place on 20 June 1944, at thePeenemünde Army Research CenterinPeenemünde. It was the first human-made object to reachouter space, attaining anapogeeof 176 kilometers,which is well above theKármán line.It was a vertical test launch. Although the rocket reached space, it did not reachorbital velocity, and therefore returned to Earth in an impact, becoming the firstsub-orbital spaceflight.In 1949, theBumper-WACreached an altitude of 393 kilometres (244 mi), becoming the first human-made object to enter space, according toNASA. The first successful orbital launch was of theSovietuncrewedSputnik 1(\"Satellite 1\") mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed about 83 kg (183 lb), and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about 250 km (160 mi). It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40 MHz), which emitted \"beeps\" that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by ameteoroid.Sputnik 1was launched by anR-7rocket. It burned up upon re-entry on 3 January 1958. The first successful human spaceflight wasVostok 1(\"East 1\"), carrying the 27-year-old Russiancosmonaut,Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advancedSoviet space programand it opened an entirely new era in space exploration:human spaceflight. The first artificial object to reach another celestial body wasLuna 2which reached theMoonin 1959.The firstsoft landingon another celestial body was performed byLuna 9landing on the Moon on 3 February 1966.Luna 10became the first artificial satellite of the Moon, entering in a lunar orbit on 3 April 1966. The first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed byApollo 11on 20 July 1969, landing on the Moon. There have been a total of six spacecraft with humanslanding on the Moonstarting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972. The first interplanetaryflybywas the 1961Venera 1flyby ofVenus, though the 1962Mariner 2was the first flyby ofVenusto return data (closest approach 34,773 kilometers).Pioneer 6was the first satellite to orbit theSun, launched on 16 December 1965. The other planets were first flown by in 1965 forMarsbyMariner 4, 1973 forJupiterbyPioneer 10, 1974 forMercurybyMariner 10, 1979 forSaturnbyPioneer 11, 1986 forUranusbyVoyager 2, 1989 forNeptunebyVoyager 2. In 2015, thedwarf planetsCeresandPlutowere orbited byDawnand passed byNew Horizons, respectively. This accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in theSolar System, theSun, theMoon, andCeresandPluto(two of the fiverecognized dwarf planets). The first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing ofVenera 7, which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes fromVenus. In 1975,Venera 9was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus. In 1971, theMars 3mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds. Later, much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation byViking 1from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus byVenera 13in 1982, the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission. Venus and Mars are the two planets outside of Earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewedrobotic spacecraft. Salyut 1was the firstspace stationof any kind, launched intolow Earth orbitby theSoviet Unionon 19 April 1971. TheInternational Space Station(ISS) is currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations, inhabited continuously since the year 2000. The other, Tiangong space station built by China, is now fully crewed and operational. Voyager 1became the first human-made object toleave the Solar Systemintointerstellar spaceon 25 August 2012. The probe passed theheliopauseat 121AUto enterinterstellar space. TheApollo 13flight passed thefar side of the Moonat an altitude of 254 kilometers (158 miles; 137 nautical miles) above the lunar surface, and 400,171 km (248,655 mi) from Earth, marking therecordfor the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth in 1970. As of 9 February 2025[update]Voyager 1was at a distance of 166.4 AU (24.89 billion km; 15.47 billion mi) from Earth.It is the most distant human-made object from Earth. Starting in the mid-20th century probes and then human missions were sent into Earth orbit, and then on to the Moon. Also, probes were sent throughout the known Solar System, and into Solar orbit. Uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury by the 21st century, and the most distance active spacecraft,Voyager 1and2traveled beyond 100 times the Earth-Sun distance. The instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the Sun's heliosphere, a sort of bubble of particles made in the Galaxy by the Sun'ssolar wind. TheSunis a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth's magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth's surface. The Sun generates mostspace weather, which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with theApollo Telescope Mount, have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective.Parker Solar Probe, launched in 2018, will approach the Sun to within 1/9th the orbit of Mercury. Mercuryremains the least explored of theTerrestrial planets. As of May 2013, theMariner 10andMESSENGERmissions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury.MESSENGERentered orbit around Mercury in March 2011, to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 (Munsell, 2006b). A third mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in 2025,BepiColombois to include twoprobes. BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and theEuropean Space Agency.MESSENGERand BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10'sflybys. Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, ordelta-v. Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable. Venuswas the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first flyby was the 1961Venera 1, though the 1962Mariner 2was the first flyby to successfully return data. Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide agravitational assisten route to other celestial bodies. In 1967,Venera 4became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In 1970,Venera 7became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in 1975, with the Soviet orbiterVenera 9, some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus usingradarto pierce the obscuring atmosphere. Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference. For example, the existence of theVan Allen radiation beltswas unknown until their discovery by the United States' first artificial satellite,Explorer 1. These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical. Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space-based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, thehole in the ozone layerwas found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify. TheMoonwas the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans. In 1959, the Soviets obtained the first images of thefar side of the Moon, never previously visible to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with theRanger 4impactor in 1962. Starting in 1966, the Soviets successfully deployed a number oflandersto the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later,Surveyor 1marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in theLunokhod programin the early 1970s, which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfullybrought lunar soil samples to Earthfor study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth. Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters. China'sChang'e 4in 2019 andChang'e 6in 2024 achieved the world's first landing and sample return on thefar side of the Moon. India'sChandrayaan-3in 2023 achieved the world's first landing on thelunar south poleregion. Crewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with theApollo 8mission that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In 1969, theApollo 11mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long. TheApollo 17mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit.Artemis IIis scheduled to complete a crewed flyby of the Moon in 2025, andArtemis IIIwill perform the first lunar landing since Apollo 17 with it scheduled for launch no earlier than 2026. Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously. The exploration ofMarshas been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan, and India. Dozens ofrobotic spacecraft, includingorbiters,landers, androvers, have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the Red Planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth. The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak ofThe Great Galactic Ghoulwhich subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This phenomenon is also informally known as the \"Mars Curse\".In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars,Indiahas become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt. India'sMars Orbiter Mission(MOM)is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of₹450Crore(US$73 million).The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates. Called theEmirates Mars Mission, it was launched on 19 July 2020 and went into orbit around Mars on 9 February 2021. The uncrewed exploratory probe was named \"Hope Probe\" and was sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail. The Russian space missionFobos-Grunt, which launched on 9 November 2011, experienced a failure leaving it stranded inlow Earth orbit.It was to begin exploration of thePhobosand Martian circumterrestrial orbit, and study whether the moons of Mars, or at least Phobos, could be a \"trans-shipment point\" for spaceships traveling to Mars. Until the advent ofspace travel, objects in theasteroid beltwere merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which wasGalileo, which flew past two:951 Gasprain 1991, followed by243 Idain 1993. Both of these lay near enough toGalileo's planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by theNEAR Shoemakerprobe in 2000, following an orbital survey of the object,433 Eros. The dwarf planetCeresand the asteroid4 Vesta, two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA'sDawnspacecraft, launched in 2007. Hayabusawas arobotic spacecraftdeveloped by theJapan Aerospace Exploration Agencytoreturn a sample of materialfrom the small near-Earth asteroid25143 Itokawato Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September 2005. After arriving at Itokawa,Hayabusastudied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November 2005, it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010. The exploration ofJupiterhas consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973. A large majority of the missions have been \"flybys\", in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as inPioneerandVoyagerprograms. TheGalileoandJunospacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet's orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is precluded. Reaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of 9.2 km/s,which is comparable to the 9.7 km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.Fortunately,gravity assiststhroughplanetary flybyscan be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration. Jupiter has 95known moons, many of which have relatively little known information about them. Saturnhas been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission (Cassini–Huygens) planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions consist of flybys in 1979 byPioneer 11, in 1980 byVoyager 1, in 1982 byVoyager 2and an orbital mission by theCassinispacecraft, which lasted from 2004 until 2017. Saturn has at least 62known moons, although the exact number is debatable since Saturn's rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes. The largest of the moons isTitan, which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth. Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander, theHuygensprobe deployed by theCassinispacecraft. The exploration ofUranushas been entirely through theVoyager 2spacecraft, with no other visits currently planned. Given itsaxial tiltof 97.77°, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986.Voyager 2studied the planet's unique atmosphere andmagnetosphere.Voyager 2also examined itsring systemand themoons of Uranusincluding all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons. Images of Uranus proved to have a uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be unique, being profoundly affected by the planet's unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence thatMirandahad been unusually geologically active. The exploration of Neptune began with the 25 August 1989Voyager 2flyby, the sole visit to the system. The possibility of aNeptune Orbiterhas been discussed, but no other missions have been given serious thought. Although the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus duringVoyager 2's visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds,auroras, and even a conspicuousanticyclone storm systemrivaled in size only by Jupiter'sGreat Red Spot. Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as 2,100 km/h.Voyager 2also examinedNeptune's ringandmoon system. It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring \"arcs\" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune's three previously known moons,Voyager 2also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which,Proteus, proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data fromVoyager 2supported the view that Neptune's largest moon,Triton, is a capturedKuiper beltobject. Thedwarf planetPluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times) and small mass (making capture into orbit difficult at present).Voyager 1could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby.Voyager 2never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto. After an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbedNew Horizonswas granted funding from the United States government in 2003.New Horizonswas launched successfully on 19 January 2006. In early 2007 the craft made use of agravity assistfromJupiter. Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015; scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter. TheNew Horizonsmission also performed a flyby of the small planetesimalArrokoth, in theKuiper belt, in 2019. This was its first extended mission. Although many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries-worth of observations, only a few comets have been closely visited. In 1985, theInternational Cometary Explorerconducted the first comet fly-by (21P/Giacobini-Zinner) before joining theHalley Armadastudying the famous comet. TheDeep Impactprobesmashed into9P/Tempelto learn more about its structure and composition and theStardustmissionreturned samples of another comet's tail. ThePhilaelandersuccessfully landed onComet Churyumov–Gerasimenkoin 2014 as part of the broaderRosettamission. Deep space exploration is the branch ofastronomy,astronauticsandspace technologythat is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space.Physical exploration of space is conducted both byhuman spaceflights(deep-space astronautics) and byrobotic spacecraft. Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies includeanti-matter,nuclear powerandbeamed propulsion.Beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes. Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by theBreakthrough Initiativesto develop a proof-of-concept fleet oflight sailspacecraft namedStarChip,to be capable of making the journey to theAlpha Centauristar system 4.37light-yearsaway. It was founded in 2016 byYuri Milner,Stephen Hawking, andMark Zuckerberg. An article in the science magazineNaturesuggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars. In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, \"a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit\"; second, \"extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars\"; and finally, \"developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin\". Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure. The Artemis program is an ongoingcrewed spaceflight programcarried out byNASA, U.S.commercial spaceflight companies, and international partners such asESA,with the goal of landing \"the first woman and the next man\" on the Moon, specifically at thelunar south poleregion. Artemis would be the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans toMars. In 2017, the lunar campaign was authorized bySpace Policy Directive 1, using various ongoing spacecraft programs such asOrion, theLunar Gateway,Commercial Lunar Payload Services, and adding an undeveloped crewed lander. TheSpace Launch Systemwill serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion, while commercial launch vehicles are planned for use to launch other elements of the campaign.NASA requested $1.6 billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year 2020,while the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a five-year budget profilewhich is needed for evaluation and approval by the U.S.Congress.As of 2024, the first Artemis mission was launched in 2022 with the second mission, a crewed lunar flyby planned for 2025.Construction on the Lunar Gateway is underway with initial capabilities set for the 2025–2027 timeframe.The first CLPS lander landed in 2024, marking the first US spacecraft to land sinceApollo 17. The research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such asNASAandRoscosmos, is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such asNASA spin-offs), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program.It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions of dollars' worth of minerals and metals. Such expeditions could generate substantial revenue.In addition, it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering.Space exploration also gives scientists the ability to perform experiments in other settings and expand humanity's knowledge. Another claim is that space exploration is a necessity to humankind and that staying on Earth will eventually lead toextinction. Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic.Stephen Hawking, renowned British theoretical physicist, said, \"I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.\"AuthorArthur C. Clarke(1950) presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monographInterplanetary Flight.He argued that humanity's choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death. These motivations could be attributed to one of the first rocket scientists in NASA,Wernher von Braun, and his vision of humans moving beyond Earth. The basis of this plan was to: Develop multi-stage rockets capable of placing satellites, animals, and humans in space. Development of large, winged reusable spacecraft capable of carrying humans and equipment into Earth orbit in a way that made space access routine and cost-effective. Construction of a large, permanently occupied space station to be used as a platform both to observe Earth and from which to launch deep space expeditions. Launching the first human flights around the Moon, leading to the first landings of humans on the Moon, with the intent of exploring that body and establishing permanent lunar bases. Assembly and fueling of spaceships in Earth orbit for the purpose of sending humans to Mars with the intent of eventually colonizing that planet. Known as the Von Braun Paradigm, the plan was formulated to lead humans in the exploration of space. Von Braun's vision of human space exploration served as the model for efforts in space exploration well into the twenty-first century, with NASA incorporating this approach into the majority of their projects.The steps were followed out of order, as seen by the Apollo program reaching the moon before the space shuttle program was started, which in turn was used to complete the International Space Station. Von Braun's Paradigm formed NASA's drive for human exploration, in the hopes that humans discover the far reaches of the universe. NASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration. Overall, the U.S. public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration. According to anAssociated PressPoll conducted in July 2003, 71% of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is \"a good investment\", compared to 21% who did not. Space advocacyandspace policyregularly invokes exploration as ahuman nature. Spaceflightis the use ofspace technologyto achieve the flight ofspacecraftinto and through outer space. Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities likespace tourismandsatellite telecommunications. Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight includespace observatories,reconnaissance satellitesand otherEarth observation satellites. A spaceflight typically begins with arocket launch, which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force ofgravityand propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study calledastrodynamics. Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate duringatmospheric reentry, and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact. Satellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites.Space stationsand humanspacecraftin orbit are also satellites. The commercialization of space first started out with the launching of private satellites by NASA or other space agencies. Current examples of the commercial satellite use of space includesatellite navigation systems, satellite television, satellite communications (such as internet services) andsatellite radio. The next step of commercialization of space was seen as human spaceflight. Flying humans safely to and from space had become routine to NASA and Russia.Reusable spacecraft were an entirely new engineering challenge, something only seen in novels and films like Star Trek and War of the Worlds. AstronautBuzz Aldrinsupported the use of making a reusable vehicle like the space shuttle. Aldrin held that reusable spacecraft were the key in making space travel affordable, stating that the use of \"passenger space travel is a huge potential market big enough to justify the creation of reusable launch vehicles\".Space tourismis a next step in the use of reusable vehicles in the commercialization of space. The purpose of this form ofspace travelis personal pleasure. Private spaceflight companiessuch asSpaceXandBlue Origin, andcommercial space stationssuch as the Axiom Space and theBigelow Commercial Space Stationhave changed the cost and overall landscape of space exploration, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future. Astrobiology is theinterdisciplinarystudy of life in the universe, combining aspects ofastronomy,biologyand geology.It is focused primarily on the study of theorigin, distribution andevolutionof life. It is also known asexobiology(from Greek: έξω,exo, \"outside\").The term \"Xenobiology\" has been used as well, but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means \"biology of the foreigners\".Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth.In the Solar System, some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan. To date, the longest human occupation of space is theInternational Space Stationwhich has been in continuous use for 24 years, 359 days.Valeri Polyakov's record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard theMirspace station has not been surpassed. The health effects of space have been well documented through years of research conducted in the field ofaerospace medicine. Analog environments similar to those experienced in space travel (like deep sea submarines), have been used in this research to further explore the relationship between isolation and extreme environments.It is imperative that the health of the crew be maintained as any deviation from baseline may compromise the integrity of the mission as well as the safety of the crew, hence the astronauts must endure rigorous medical screenings and tests prior to embarking on any missions. However, it does not take long for the environmental dynamics of spaceflight to commence its toll on the human body; for example,space motion sickness (SMS)– a condition which affects the neurovestibular system and culminates in mild to severe signs and symptoms such as vertigo, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and disorientation – plagues almost all space travelers within their first few days in orbit.Space travel can also have an impact on the psyche of the crew members as delineated in anecdotal writings composed after their retirement. Space travel can adversely affect the body's natural biological clock (circadian rhythm); sleep patterns causing sleep deprivation and fatigue; and social interaction; consequently, residing in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment for a prolonged amount of time can result in both mental and physical exhaustion.Long-term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune system suppression, problems with eyesight, and radiation exposure. The lack of gravity causes fluid to rise upward which can cause pressure to build up in the eye, resulting in vision problems; the loss of bone minerals and densities; cardiovascular deconditioning; and decreased endurance and muscle mass. Radiationis an insidious health hazard to space travelers as it is invisible and can cause cancer. When above the Earth's magnetic field, spacecraft are no longer protected from the sun's radiation; the danger of radiation is even more potent in deep space. The hazards of radiation can be ameliorated through protective shielding on the spacecraft, alerts, anddosimetry. Fortunately, with new and rapidly evolving technological advancements, those inMission Controlare able to monitor the health of theirastronautsmore closely usingtelemedicine. One may not be able to completely evade the physiological effects of space flight, but those effects can be mitigated. For example, medical systems aboard space vessels such as theInternational Space Station (ISS)are well equipped and designed to counteract the effects of lack of gravity and weightlessness; on-board treadmills can help prevent muscle loss and reduce the risk of developing prematureosteoporosis.Additionally, a crew medical officer is appointed for each ISS mission and aflight surgeonis available 24/7 via theISS Mission Control Centerlocated inHouston, Texas.Although the interactions are intended to take place in real time, communications between the space and terrestrial crew may become delayed – sometimes by as much as 20 minutes– as their distance from each other increases when the spacecraft moves further out of low Earth orbit; because of this the crew are trained and need to be prepared to respond to any medical emergencies that may arise on the vessel as the ground crew are hundreds of miles away. Many past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a \"steppingstone\" to the other planets, especially Mars. At the end of 2006, NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024. Beyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack ofprivate property, the inability or difficulty in establishingproperty rightsin space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent ofspace technologyin the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making ofnationalterritorial claimsinouter spaceand oncelestial bodieshas been specifically proscribed by theOuter Space Treaty, which had been, as of 2012[update], ratified by allspacefaring nations.Space colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) humanhabitationof locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as theMoonorMars, using significant amounts ofin-situ resource utilization. Participation and representation of humanity in space is an issue ever since the first phase of space exploration.Some rights of non-spacefaring countries have been mostly secured through internationalspace law, declaring space the \"province of all mankind\", understandingspaceflightas its resource, though sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized asimperialistand lacking.Additionally to international inclusion, the inclusion of women andpeople of colourhas also been lacking. To reach a more inclusive spaceflight, some organizations like theJustspace AllianceandIAUfeaturedInclusive Astronomyhave been formed in recent years. The first woman to go to space wasValentina Tereshkova. She flew in 1963 but it was not until the 1980s that another woman entered space again. All astronauts were required to be military test pilots at the time and women were not able to join this career. This is one reason for the delay in allowing women to join space crews.After the rule changed,Svetlana Savitskayabecame the second woman to go to space, she was also from theSoviet Union.Sally Ridebecame the next woman in space and the first woman to fly to space through the United States program. Since then, eleven other countries have allowed women astronauts. The first all-female space walk occurred in 2018, includingChristina KochandJessica Meir. They had both previously participated in space walks with NASA. The first woman to go to the Moon is planned for 2026. Despite these developments, women are underrepresented among astronauts and especially cosmonauts. Issues that block potential applicants from the programs, and limit the space missions they are able to go on, include: Artistry in and from space ranges from signals, capturing and arranging material likeYuri Gagarin'sselfiein space or the imageThe Blue Marble, over drawings like the first one in space by cosmonaut and artistAlexei Leonov, music videos likeChris Hadfield's cover of Space Oddityon board the ISS, to permanent installations on celestial bodies likeon the Moon.\n",

            "TheApollo program, also known asProject Apollo, was the United Stateshuman spaceflightprogram led byNASA, whichlandedthe first humans on theMoonin 1969. Apollo was conceived duringProject Mercuryand executed afterProject Gemini. It was conceived in 1960 as a three-person spacecraft during the presidency ofDwight D. Eisenhower. Apollo was later dedicated to PresidentJohn F. Kennedy's national goal for the 1960s of \"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" in an address to theU.S. Congresson May 25, 1961. Kennedy's goal was accomplished on theApollo 11mission, when astronautsNeil ArmstrongandBuzz Aldrinlanded theirApollo Lunar Module(LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, whileMichael Collinsremained inlunar orbitin thecommand and service module(CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landedastronautson the Moon, the last,Apollo 17, in December 1972. In these six spaceflights,twelve people walked on the Moon. Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It encountered a major setback in 1967 when theApollo 1cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first Moon landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunargeologicalandastrophysicalexploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved landings; but theApollo 13landing had to be aborted after an oxygen tank exploded en route to the Moon, crippling the CSM. The crew barely managed a safe return to Earth by using theLunar Moduleas a \"lifeboat\" on the return journey. Apollo used theSaturn family of rocketsas launch vehicles, which were also used for anApollo Applications Program, which consisted ofSkylab, aspace stationthat supported three crewed missions in 1973–1974, and theApollo–SoyuzTest Project, a jointUnited States-Soviet Unionlow Earth orbitmission in 1975. Apollo set several majorhuman spaceflight milestones. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyondlow Earth orbit.Apollo 8was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and Apollo 11 was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one. Overall, the Apollo program returned 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability and funded construction of itsJohnson Space CenterandKennedy Space Center. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental torocketryand human spaceflight, includingavionics,telecommunications, andcomputers. The program was named after the Greek godApolloby NASA managerAbe Silverstein, who later said, \"I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby.\"Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt \"Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program\". The context of this was that the program focused at its beginning mainly on developing an advanced crewed spacecraft, theApollo command and service module, succeeding theMercury program. Alunar landingbecame the focus of the program only in 1961.ThereafterProject Geminiinstead followed the Mercury program to test and study advanced crewed spaceflight technology. The Apollo program was conceived during the Eisenhower administration in early 1960, as a follow-up toProject Mercury. While the Mercurycapsulecould support only one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three. Possible missions included ferrying crews to aspace station,circumlunar flights, and eventual crewedlunar landings. In July 1960, NASA Deputy AdministratorHugh L. Drydenannounced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series ofSpace Task Groupconferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with amission modulecabin separate from thecommand module(piloting and reentry cabin), and apropulsion and equipment module. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded toGeneral Dynamics/Convair,General Electric, and theGlenn L. Martin Company. Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led byMaxime Faget, to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs. In November 1960,John F. Kennedywas elected president after acampaignthat promised American superiority over theSoviet Unionin the fields ofspace explorationandmissile defense. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the \"missile gap\" that he and many other senators said had developed between the Soviet Union and the United States due to the inaction of President Eisenhower.Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not \"first but, first and, first if, but first period\".Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew little about the technical details of the space program, and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a crewed Moon landing.When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA AdministratorJames E. Webbrequested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue. On April 12, 1961, SovietcosmonautYuri Gagarinbecame the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the US HouseCommittee on Science and Astronauticsone day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets. On April 20, Kennedy sent a memo toVice PresidentLyndon B. Johnson, asking Johnson to look into the status of America's space program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up.Johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that \"we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership.\"His memo concluded that a crewed Moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the United States would achieve it first. On May 25, 1961, twenty days after the first American crewed spaceflightFreedom 7, Kennedy proposed the crewed Moon landing in aSpecial Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs: Now it is time to take longer strides—time for a great new American enterprise—time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on Earth. ...I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important in the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.[a] At the time of Kennedy's proposal, only one American had flown in space—less than a month earlier—and NASA had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit. Even some NASA employees doubted whether Kennedy's ambitious goal could be met.By 1963, Kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint US-USSR Moon mission, to eliminate duplication of effort. With the clear goal of a crewed landing replacing the more nebulous goals of space stations and circumlunar flights, NASA decided that, in order to make progress quickly, it would discard the feasibility study designs of Convair, GE, and Martin, and proceed with Faget's command and service module design. The mission module was determined to be useful only as an extra room, and therefore unnecessary.They used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961. On November 28, 1961, it was announced thatNorth American Aviationhad won the contract, although its bid was not rated as good as the Martin proposal. Webb, Dryden andRobert Seamanschose it in preference due to North American's longer association with NASA andits predecessor. Landing humans on the Moon by the end of 1969 required the most sudden burst of technological creativity, and the largest commitment of resources ($25 billion; $187 billion in 2024 US dollars)ever made by any nation in peacetime. At its peak, the Apollo program employed 400,000 people and required the support of over 20,000 industrial firms and universities. On July 1, 1960, NASA established theMarshall Space Flight Center(MSFC) inHuntsville, Alabama. MSFC designed the heavy lift-classSaturn launch vehicles, which would be required for Apollo. It became clear that managing the Apollo program would exceed the capabilities ofRobert R. Gilruth'sSpace Task Group, which had been directing the nation's crewed space program from NASA'sLangley Research Center. So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center, theManned Spacecraft Center(MSC). A site was chosen inHouston, Texas, on land donated byRice University, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19, 1961.It was also clear NASA would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from itsCape Canaveral Air Force Stationlaunch facilities in Florida, so a newMission Control Centerwould be included in the MSC. In September 1962, by which time two Project Mercury astronauts had orbited the Earth, Gilruth had moved his organization to rented space in Houston, and construction of the MSC facility was under way, Kennedy visited Rice to reiterate his challenge ina famous speech: But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, whyclimb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago,fly the Atlantic?...\n",
            "We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills; because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win...[b] The MSC was completed in September 1963. It was renamed by theUnited States Congressin honor ofLyndon B. Johnsonsoon after his death in 1973. It also became clear that Apollo would outgrow theCanaveral launch facilitiesinFlorida. The two newest launch complexes were already being built for theSaturn IandIBrockets at the northernmost end:LC-34andLC-37. But an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the crewed lunar mission, so land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center (LOC) immediately north of Canaveral atMerritt Island. The design, development and construction of the center was conducted byKurt H. Debus, a member ofWernher von Braun's originalV-2 rocketengineering team. Debus was named the LOC's first Director.Construction began in November 1962. FollowingKennedy's death, President Johnson issued an executive order on November 29, 1963, to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor of Kennedy. The LOC includedLaunch Complex 39, aLaunch Control Center, and a 130-million-cubic-foot (3,700,000 m3)Vertical Assembly Building(VAB).in which the space vehicle (launch vehicle and spacecraft) would be assembled on amobile launcher platformand then moved by acrawler-transporterto one of several launch pads. Although at least three pads were planned, only two, designated AandB, were completed in October 1965. The LOC also included anOperations and Checkout Building(OCB) to whichGeminiand Apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles. The Apollo spacecraft could be tested in twovacuum chamberscapable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to 250,000 feet (76 km), which is nearly a vacuum. AdministratorWebbrealized that in order to keep Apollo costs under control, he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization, so he recruitedGeorge E. Muellerfor a high management job. Mueller accepted, on the condition that he have a say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo. Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF).On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to replace then Associate AdministratorD. Brainerd Holmeson his retirement effective September 1. Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth),Marshall Space Flight Center(von Braun), and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) reported to Mueller. Based on his industry experience on Air Force missile projects, Mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high-ranking officers in theU.S. Air Force, so he got Webb's permission to recruit GeneralSamuel C. Phillips, who gained a reputation for his effective management of theMinutemanprogram, as OMSF program controller. Phillips's superior officerBernard A. Schrieveragreed to loan Phillips to NASA, along with a staff of officers under him, on the condition that Phillips be made Apollo Program Director. Mueller agreed, and Phillips managed Apollo from January 1964, until it achieved the first human landing in July 1969, after which he returned to Air Force duty. Charles Fishman, inOne Giant Leap, estimated the number of people and organizations involved into the Apollo program as \"410,000 men and women at some 20,000 different companies contributed to the effort\". Once Kennedy had defined a goal, the Apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a spacecraft that could meet it while minimizing risk to human life, limiting cost, and not exceeding limits in possible technology and astronaut skill.  Four possible mission modes were considered: In early 1961, direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at NASA. Many engineers feared that rendezvous and docking, maneuvers that had not been attempted inEarth orbit, would be nearly impossible inlunar orbit. LOR advocates includingJohn Houboltat Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke \"somewhat as a voice in the wilderness\", Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question. Seamans's establishment of an ad hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend alaunch vehicleto be used in the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision.This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR—as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight,Joseph Shea, who became a champion of LOR.The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), who were heavily invested in direct ascent, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced byWernher von Braunat a briefing on June 7, 1962. But even after NASA reached internal agreement, it was far from smooth sailing. Kennedy'sscience advisorJerome Wiesner, who had expressed his opposition to human spaceflight to Kennedy before the President took office,and had opposed the decision to land people on the Moon, hired Golovin, who had left NASA, to chair his own \"Space Vehicle Panel\", ostensibly to monitor, but actually to second-guess NASA's decisions on theSaturn Vlaunch vehicle and LOR by forcing Shea, Seamans, and even Webb to defend themselves, delaying its formal announcement to the press on July 11, 1962, and forcing Webb to still hedge the decision as \"tentative\". Wiesner kept up the pressure, even making the disagreement public during a two-day September visit by the President toMarshall Space Flight Center. Wiesner blurted out \"No, that's no good\" in front of the press, during a presentation by von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was \"still subject to final review\". Webb held firm and issued arequest for proposalto candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the OctoberCuban Missile Crisis, and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb. NASA announced the selection ofGrummanas the LEM contractor in November 1962. Space historian James Hansen concludes that: Without NASA's adoption of this stubbornly held minority opinion in 1962, the United States may still have reached the Moon, but almost certainly it would not have been accomplished by the end of the 1960s, President Kennedy's target date. The LOR method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a \"lifeboat\" in the event of a failure of the command ship. Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. In 1964 an MSC study concluded, \"TheLM[as lifeboat]... was finally dropped, because no single reasonableCSMfailure could be identified that would prohibit use of theSPS.\"Ironically, just such a failure happened onApollo 13when an oxygen tank explosion left the CSM without electrical power. The lunar module provided propulsion, electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely. Faget's preliminary Apollo design employed a cone-shaped command module, supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a command and service module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to LM (Lunar Module) but still pronounced/ˈlɛm/) which would take two individuals to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM. Thecommand module(CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing. It was the only component of the Apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early Apollo study designs. Its exterior was covered with anablative heat shield, and had its ownreaction control system(RCS) engines tocontrol its attitudeand steer itsatmospheric entrypath. Parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown. The module was 11.42 feet (3.48 m) tall, 12.83 feet (3.91 m) in diameter, and weighed approximately 12,250 pounds (5,560 kg). A cylindricalservice module(SM) supported the command module, with a service propulsion engine and an RCS with propellants, and afuel cellpower generation system withliquid hydrogenandliquid oxygenreactants. A high-gainS-bandantenna was used for long-distance communications on the lunar flights. On the extended lunar missions, an orbital scientific instrument package was carried. The service module was discarded just before reentry. The module was 24.6 feet (7.5 m) long and 12.83 feet (3.91 m) in diameter. The initial lunar flight version weighed approximately 51,300 pounds (23,300 kg) fully fueled, while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over 54,000 pounds (24,000 kg). North American Aviationwon the contract to build the CSM, and also the second stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight.Also, there was no provision for docking with the lunar module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development. TheApollo Lunar Module(LM) was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, each with its own engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately 33,300 pounds (15,100 kg), and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. Anextended lunar module(ELM) weighed over 36,200 pounds (16,400 kg), and allowed surface stays of more than three days.The contract for design and construction of the lunar module was awarded toGrumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen byThomas J. Kelly. Before the Apollo program began, Wernher von Braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles, theSaturn series, and the even largerNovaseries. In the midst of these plans, von Braun was transferred from the Army to NASA and was made Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center. The initial direct ascent plan to send the three-person Apollo command and service module directly to the lunar surface, on top of a large descent rocket stage, would require a Nova-class launcher, with a lunar payload capability of over 180,000 pounds (82,000 kg).The June 11, 1962, decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the Saturn V to replace the Nova, and the MSFC proceeded to develop theSaturn rocket familyfor Apollo. Since Apollo, like Mercury, used more than one launch vehicle for space missions, NASA used spacecraft-launch vehicle combination series numbers: AS-10x for Saturn I, AS-20x for Saturn IB, and AS-50x for Saturn V (compareMercury-Redstone 3,Mercury-Atlas 6) to designate and plan all missions, rather than numbering them sequentially as in Project Gemini. This was changed by the time human flights began. Since Apollo, like Mercury, would require alaunch escape system(LES) in case of a launch failure, a relatively small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system. A rocket bigger than theLittle Joeused by Mercury would be required, so theLittle Joe IIwas built byGeneral Dynamics/Convair. After an August 1963qualification test flight,four LES test flights (A-001through004) were made at theWhite Sands Missile Rangebetween May 1964 and January 1966. Saturn I, the first US heavy lift launch vehicle, was initially planned to launch partially equipped CSMs in low Earth orbit tests. TheS-Ifirst stage burnedRP-1with liquid oxygen (LOX) oxidizer in eight clusteredRocketdyne H-1engines, to produce 1,500,000 pounds-force (6,670 kN) of thrust. TheS-IVsecond stage used six liquid hydrogen-fueledPratt & WhitneyRL-10engines with 90,000 pounds-force (400 kN) of thrust. TheS-Vthird stage flew inactively on Saturn I four times. The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC-34, with only the first stage live, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water. The first flight with a live S-IV was launched from LC-37. This was followed by five launches ofboilerplateCSMs (designatedAS-101throughAS-105) into orbit in 1964 and 1965. The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carryingPegasussatellites, which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity ofmicrometeoriteimpacts. In September 1962, NASA planned to launch four crewed CSM flights on the Saturn I from late 1965 through 1966, concurrent with Project Gemini. The 22,500-pound (10,200 kg) payload capacitywould have severely limited the systems which could be included, so the decision was made in October 1963 to use the upratedSaturn IBfor all crewed Earth orbital flights. The Saturn IB was an upgraded version of the Saturn I. TheS-IBfirst stage increased the thrust to 1,600,000 pounds-force (7,120 kN) by uprating the H-1 engine. The second stage replaced the S-IV with theS-IVB-200, powered by a singleJ-2engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with LOX, to produce 200,000pounds-force(890kN) of thrust.A restartable version of the S-IVB was used as the third stage of the Saturn V. The Saturn IB could send over 40,000 pounds (18,100 kg) into low Earth orbit, sufficient for a partially fueled CSM or the LM.Saturn IB launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-200 series number, \"AS\" indicating \"Apollo Saturn\" and the \"2\" indicating the second member of the Saturn rocket family. Saturn V launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-500 series number, \"AS\" indicating \"Apollo Saturn\" and the \"5\" indicating Saturn V.The three-stage Saturn V was designed to send a fully fueled CSM and LM to the Moon. It was 33 feet (10.1 m) in diameter and stood 363 feet (110.6 m) tall with its 96,800-pound (43,900 kg) lunar payload. Its capability grew to 103,600 pounds (47,000 kg) for the later advanced lunar landings. TheS-ICfirst stage burned RP-1/LOX for a rated thrust of 7,500,000 pounds-force (33,400 kN), which was upgraded to 7,610,000 pounds-force (33,900 kN). The second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen; the third stage was a modified version of the S-IVB, with thrust increased to 230,000 pounds-force (1,020 kN) and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching aparking orbit. NASA's director of flight crew operations during the Apollo program wasDonald K. \"Deke\" Slayton, one of the originalMercury Sevenastronauts who was medically grounded in September 1962 due to aheart murmur. Slayton was responsible for making all Gemini and Apollo crew assignments. Thirty-two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the Apollo program. Twenty-four of these left Earth's orbit and flew around the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972 (three of them twice). Half of the 24 walked on the Moon's surface, though none of them returned to it after landing once. One of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist. Of the 32,Gus Grissom,Ed White, andRoger Chaffeewere killed during a ground test in preparation for theApollo 1mission. The Apollo astronauts were chosen from the Project Mercury and Gemini veterans, plus from two later astronaut groups. All missions were commanded by Gemini or Mercury veterans. Crews on all development flights (except the Earth orbit CSM development flights) through the first two landings on Apollo 11 andApollo 12, included at least two (sometimes three) Gemini veterans.Harrison Schmitt, a geologist, was the firstNASA scientist astronautto fly in space, and landed on the Moon on the last mission, Apollo 17. Schmitt participated in thelunar geologytraining of all of the Apollo landing crews. NASA awarded all 32 of these astronauts its highest honor, theDistinguished Service Medal, given for \"distinguished service, ability, or courage\", and personal \"contribution representing substantial progress to the NASA mission\". The medals were awarded posthumously to Grissom, White, and Chaffee in 1969, then to the crews of all missions fromApollo 8onward. The crew that flew the first Earth orbital test missionApollo 7,Walter M. Schirra,Donn Eisele, andWalter Cunningham, were awarded the lesserNASA Exceptional Service Medal, because of discipline problems with theflight director's orders during their flight. In October 2008, theNASA Administratordecided to award them the Distinguished Service Medals. For Schirra and Eisele, this was posthumously. The first lunar landing mission was planned to proceed: Two Block I CSMs were launched from LC-34 on suborbital flights in 1966 with the Saturn IB. The first,AS-201launched on February 26, reached an altitude of 265.7 nautical miles (492.1 km) and splashed down 4,577 nautical miles (8,477 km) downrange in theAtlantic Ocean.The second,AS-202on August 25, reached 617.1 nautical miles (1,142.9 km) altitude and was recovered 13,900 nautical miles (25,700 km) downrange in the Pacific Ocean. These flights validated the service module engine and the command module heat shield. A third Saturn IB test,AS-203launched from pad 37, went into orbit to support design of the S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nose cone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight. Two crewed orbital Block I CSM missions were planned: AS-204 and AS-205. The Block I crew positions were titled Command Pilot, Senior Pilot, and Pilot. The Senior Pilot would assume navigation duties, while the Pilot would function as a systems engineer.The astronauts would weara modified version of the Gemini spacesuit. After an uncrewed LM test flight AS-206, a crew would fly the first Block II CSM and LM in a dual mission known as AS-207/208, or AS-278 (each spacecraft would be launched on a separate Saturn IB).The Block II crew positions were titled Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Lunar Module Pilot. The astronauts would begin wearing a newApollo A6L spacesuit, designed to accommodate lunarextravehicular activity(EVA). The traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear \"fishbowl\" type for greater visibility, and the lunar surface EVA suit would include a water-cooled undergarment. Deke Slayton, the groundedMercury astronautwho became director of flight crew operations for the Gemini and Apollo programs, selected the first Apollo crew in January 1966, with Grissom as Command Pilot, White as Senior Pilot, and rookieDonn F. Eiseleas Pilot. But Eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard theKC135 weightlessness training aircraft, and had to undergo surgery on January 27. Slayton replaced him with Chaffee.NASA announced the final crew selection for AS-204 on March 21, 1966, with the backup crew consisting of Gemini veteransJames McDivittandDavid Scott, with rookieRussell L. \"Rusty\" Schweickart. Mercury/Gemini veteranWally Schirra, Eisele, and rookieWalter Cunninghamwere announced on September 29 as the prime crew for AS-205. In December 1966, the AS-205 mission was canceled, since the validation of the CSM would be accomplished on the 14-day first flight, and AS-205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft. Its Saturn IB was allocated to the dual mission, now redesignated AS-205/208 or AS-258, planned for August 1967. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were promoted to the prime AS-258 crew, and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the Apollo1 backup crew. The spacecraft for the AS-202 and AS-204 missions were delivered by North American Aviation to the Kennedy Space Center with long lists of equipment problems which had to be corrected before flight; these delays caused the launch of AS-202 to slip behind AS-203, and eliminated hopes the first crewed mission might be ready to launch as soon as November 1966, concurrently with the last Gemini mission. Eventually, the planned AS-204 flight date was pushed to February 21, 1967. North American Aviation was prime contractor not only for the Apollo CSM, but for the SaturnVS-IIsecond stage as well, and delays in this stage pushed the first uncrewed SaturnV flight AS-501 from late 1966 to November 1967. (The initial assembly of AS-501 had to use a dummy spacer spool in place of the stage.) The problems with North American were severe enough in late 1965 to cause Manned Space Flight Administrator George Mueller to appoint program director Samuel Phillips to head a \"tiger team\" to investigate North American's problems and identify corrections. Phillips documented his findings in a December 19 letter to NAA presidentLee Atwood, with a strongly worded letter by Mueller, and also gave a presentation of the results to Mueller and Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans.Meanwhile,Grummanwas also encountering problems with the Lunar Module, eliminating hopes it would be ready for crewed flight in 1967, not long after the first crewed CSM flights. Grissom, White, and Chaffee decided to name their flight Apollo1 as a motivational focus on the first crewed flight. They trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at North American, and in the altitude chamber at the Kennedy Space Center. A \"plugs-out\" test was planned for January, which would simulate a launch countdown on LC-34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power. If successful, this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the February 21 launch, with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled. The plugs-out test began on the morning of January 27, 1967, and immediately was plagued with problems. First, the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits which delayed the sealing of the hatch. Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst, allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened. NASA immediately convened an accident review board, overseen by both houses of Congress. While the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex, the review board concluded that \"deficiencies existed in command module design, workmanship and quality control\".At the insistence of NASA Administrator Webb, North American removedHarrison Stormsas command module program manager.Webb also reassigned Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) ManagerJoseph Francis Shea, replacing him withGeorge Low. To remedy the causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II spacecraft and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials.The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block Iplug-typehatch cover with a quick-release, outward opening door.NASA discontinued the crewed Block I program, using the BlockI spacecraft only for uncrewed SaturnV flights. Crew members would also exclusively wear modified, fire-resistant A7L Block II space suits, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not. On April 24, 1967, Mueller published an official Apollo mission numbering scheme, using sequential numbers for all flights, crewed or uncrewed. The sequence would start withApollo 4to cover the first three uncrewed flights while retiring the Apollo1 designation to honor the crew, per their widows' wishes. In September 1967, Mueller approved asequence of mission typeswhich had to be accomplished in order to achieve the crewed lunar landing. Each step had to be accomplished before the next ones could be performed, and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary; therefore letters were used instead of numbers. TheAmissions were uncrewed Saturn V validation;Bwas uncrewed LM validation using the Saturn IB;Cwas crewed CSM Earth orbit validation using the Saturn IB;Dwas the first crewed CSM/LM flight (this replaced AS-258, using a single Saturn V launch);Ewould be a higher Earth orbit CSM/LM flight;Fwould be the first lunar mission, testing the LM in lunar orbit but without landing (a \"dress rehearsal\"); andGwould be the first crewed landing. The list of types covered follow-on lunar exploration to includeHlunar landings,Ifor lunar orbital survey missions, andJfor extended-stay lunar landings. The delay in the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA to catch up on human-rating the LM and SaturnV. Apollo4 (AS-501) was the first uncrewed flight of the SaturnV, carrying a BlockI CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the command module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed. Apollo 5(AS-204) was the first uncrewed test flight of the LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error, which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a \"fire-in-the-hole\" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage. Although Grumman wanted a second uncrewed test, George Low decided the next LM flight would be crewed. This was followed on April 4, 1968, byApollo 6(AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the service module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experiencedpogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo6 problems, NASA declared the SaturnV ready to fly crew, canceling a third uncrewed test. Apollo 7, launched from LC-34 on October 11, 1968, was the Cmission, crewed bySchirra,Eisele, andCunningham. It was an 11-day Earth-orbital flight which tested the CSM systems. Apollo 8was planned to be the D mission in December 1968, crewed by McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart, launched on a SaturnV instead of two Saturn IBs.In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time. Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the Dmission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track. The Soviet Union had sent two tortoises, mealworms, wine flies, and other lifeforms around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboardZond 5, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts.The decision was not announced publicly until completion of Apollo 7. Gemini veteransFrank BormanandJim Lovell, and rookieWilliam Anderscaptured the world's attention by making ten lunar orbits in 20 hours, transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface onChristmas Eve, and returning safely to Earth. The following March, LM flight, rendezvous and docking were demonstrated in Earth orbit onApollo 9, and Schweickart tested the full lunarEVA suitwith itsportable life support system(PLSS) outside the LM.The F mission was carried out onApollo 10in May 1969 by Gemini veteransThomas P. Stafford,John YoungandEugene Cernan. Stafford and Cernan took the LM to within 50,000 feet (15 km) of the lunar surface. The G mission was achieved onApollo 11in July 1969 by an all-Gemini veteran crew consisting ofNeil Armstrong,Michael CollinsandBuzz Aldrin. Armstrong and Aldrin performed the first landing at theSea of Tranquilityat 20:17:40UTCon July 20, 1969. They spent a total of 21 hours, 36 minutes on the surface, and spent 2hours, 31 minutes outside the spacecraft,walking on the surface, taking photographs, collecting material samples, and deploying automated scientific instruments, while continuously sendingblack-and-white televisionback to Earth. The astronauts returned safely on July 24. That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind. —Neil Armstrong, just after stepping onto the Moon's surface In November 1969,Charles \"Pete\" Conradbecame the third person to step onto the Moon, which he did while speaking more informally than had Armstrong: Whoopee! Man, that may have been a small one forNeil, but that's a long one for me. Conrad and rookieAlan L. Beanmade a precision landing of Apollo 12 within walking distance of theSurveyor 3uncrewed lunar probe, which had landed in April 1967 on theOcean of Storms. The command module pilot was Gemini veteranRichard F. Gordon Jr.Conrad and Bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera, but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the Sun. They made two EVAs totaling 7hours and 45 minutes.On one, they walked to the Surveyor, photographed it, and removed some parts which they returned to Earth. The contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs was enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. Shortly after Apollo 11, NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites after Apollo 12, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry theLunar Roving Vehicle(LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit wasrevised for the extended missionsto allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV. The success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander, with two rookies. Apollo 13 launched Lovell,Jack Swigert, andFred Haisein April 1970, headed for theFra Mauro formation. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"lifeboat\" to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added. About the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for thedevelopmentof the upcomingSpace Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at theJohn F. Kennedy Space Centeron Merritt Island, Florida,George C. Marshall Space CenterinHuntsville, Alabama,Michoud Assembly FacilityinNew Orleans, Louisiana, andLyndon B. Johnson Space Centerin Houston, Texas. The cutbacks forced mission planners to reassess the original planned landing sites in order to achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions.Apollo 15had been planned to be the last of the H series missions, but since there would be only two subsequent missions left, it was changed to the first of three J missions. Apollo 13's Fra Mauro mission was reassigned toApollo 14, commanded in February 1971 by Mercury veteranAlan Shepard, withStuart RoosaandEdgar Mitchell.This time the mission was successful. Shepard and Mitchell spent 33 hours and 31 minutes on the surface,and completed two EVAs totalling 9hours 24 minutes, which was a record for the longest EVA by a lunar crew at the time. In August 1971, just after conclusion of the Apollo 15 mission, PresidentRichard Nixonproposed canceling the two remaining lunar landing missions, Apollo 16 and 17.Office of Management and BudgetDeputy DirectorCaspar Weinbergerwas opposed to this, and persuaded Nixon to keep the remaining missions. Apollo 15 was launched on July 26, 1971, withDavid Scott,Alfred WordenandJames Irwin. Scott and Irwin landed on July 30 nearHadley Rille, and spent just under two days, 19 hours on the surface. In over 18 hours of EVA, they collected about 77 kilograms (170 lb) of lunar material. Apollo 16 landed in theDescartes Highlandson April 20, 1972. The crew was commanded by John Young, withKen MattinglyandCharles Duke. Young and Duke spent just under three days on the surface, with a total of over 20 hours EVA. Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo program, landing in theTaurus–Littrowregion in December 1972. Eugene Cernan commandedRonald E. Evansand NASA's first scientist-astronaut, geologistHarrison H. Schmitt.Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18,but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing.Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA. Several missions were planned for but were canceled before details were finalized. Source:Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference(Orloff 2004). The Apollo program returned over 382 kg (842 lb) of lunar rocks andsoilto theLunar Receiving Laboratoryin Houston.Today, 75% of the samples are stored at theLunar Sample Laboratory Facilitybuilt in 1979. The rocks collected from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured byradiometric datingtechniques. They range in age from about 3.2 billion years for thebasalticsamples derived from thelunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from thehighlandscrust.As such, they represent samples from a very early period in the development of theSolar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed theGenesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission.Thisanorthositerock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineralanorthite, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust.A geochemical component calledKREEPwas discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart.KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (seelunar magma ocean). Almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects. Many samples appear to be pitted withmicrometeoroidimpact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high-pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are ofimpact melt(materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples returned from the Moon are highlybrecciatedas a result of being subjected to multiple impact events. From analyses of the composition of the returned lunar samples, it is now believed that the Moon wascreated through the impactof a large astronomical body with Earth. Apollo cost $25.4 billion or approximately $257 billion (2023) using improved cost analysis. Of this amount, $20.2 billion ($149 billion adjusted) was spent on the design, development, and production of theSaturn familyof launch vehicles, theApollo spacecraft,spacesuits,scientific experiments, and mission operations. The cost of constructing and operating Apollo-related ground facilities, such as the NASA human spaceflight centers and theglobal tracking and data acquisition network, added an additional $5.2 billion ($38.3 billion adjusted). The amount grows to $28 billion ($280 billion adjusted) if the costs for related projects such as Project Gemini and the roboticRanger,Surveyor, andLunar Orbiterprograms are included. NASA's official cost breakdown, as reported to Congress in the Spring of 1973, is as follows: Accurate estimates of human spaceflight costs were difficult in the early 1960s, as the capability was new and management experience was lacking. Preliminary cost analysis by NASA estimated $7 billion – $12 billion for a crewed lunar landing effort. NASA Administrator James Webb increased this estimate to $20 billion before reporting it to Vice President Johnson in April 1961. Project Apollo was a massive undertaking, representing the largest research and development project in peacetime. At its peak, it employed over 400,000 employees and contractors around the country and accounted for more than half of NASA's total spending in the 1960s.After the first Moon landing, public and political interest waned, including that of President Nixon, who wanted to rein in federal spending.NASA's budget could not sustain Apollo missions which cost, on average, $445 million ($2.73 billion adjusted)each while simultaneouslydeveloping the Space Shuttle. The final fiscal year of Apollo funding was 1973. Looking beyond the crewed lunar landings, NASA investigated several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (Apollo X) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using the space in theSpacecraft Lunar Module Adapter(SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by theApollo Telescope Mount, which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack.The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for aVenus fly-by mission. The S-IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board. DubbedSkylab, it was assembled on the ground rather than in space, and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a Saturn V. It was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount. Skylab's last crew departed the station on February 8, 1974, and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979 after development of theSpace Shuttlewas delayed too long to save it. TheApollo–Soyuzprogram also used Apollo hardware for the first joint nation spaceflight, paving the way for future cooperation with other nations in theSpace ShuttleandInternational Space Stationprograms. In 2008,Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency'sSELENEprobe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the Apollo 15 Lunar Module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface. Beginning in 2009, NASA'sroboticLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, while orbiting 50 kilometers (31 mi) above the Moon, photographed the remnants of the Apollo program left on the lunar surface, and each site where crewed Apollo flights landed.All ofU.S. flagsleft on the Moon during the Apollo missions were found to still be standing, with the exception of the one left during the Apollo 11 mission, which was blown over during that mission's lift-off from the lunar surface; the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown.The flags cannot be seen through a telescope from Earth. In a November 16, 2009, editorial,The New York Timesopined: [T]here's something terribly wistful about these photographs of the Apollo landing sites. The detail is such that if Neil Armstrong were walking there now, we could make him out, make out his footsteps even, like the astronaut footpath clearly visible in the photos of the Apollo 14 site. Perhaps the wistfulness is caused by the sense of simple grandeur in those Apollo missions. Perhaps, too, it's a reminder of the risk we all felt after the Eagle had landed—the possibility that it might be unable to lift off again and the astronauts would be stranded on the Moon. But it may also be that a photograph like this one is as close as we're able to come to looking directly back into the human past...\n",
            "There the [Apollo 11] lunar module sits, parked just where it landed 40 years ago, as if it still really were 40 years ago and all the time since merely imaginary. The Apollo program has been described as the greatest technological achievement in human history.Apollo stimulated many areas of technology, leading to over 1,800 spinoff products as of 2015, including advances in the development ofcordlesspower tools,fireproof materials,heart monitors,solar panels,digital imaging, and the use ofliquid methaneas fuel.Theflight computerdesign used in both the lunar and command modules was, along with thePolarisandMinutemanmissile systems, the driving force behind early research intointegrated circuits(ICs). By 1963, Apollo was using 60 percent of the United States' production of ICs. The crucial difference between the requirements of Apollo and the missile programs was Apollo's much greater need for reliability. Whilethe NavyandAir Forcecould work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles, the political and financial cost of failure of an Apollo mission was unacceptably high. Technologies and techniques required for Apollo were developed by Project Gemini.The Apollo project was enabled by NASA's adoption of new advances insemiconductorelectronic technology, includingmetal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors(MOSFETs) in theInterplanetary Monitoring Platform(IMP)andsiliconintegrated circuitchips in theApollo Guidance Computer(AGC). The crew of Apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the Earth and the Moon back to Earth, and read from the creation story in theBook of Genesis, onChristmas Eve1968.An estimated one-quarter of the population of the world saw—either live or delayed—the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon,and an estimated one-fifth of the population of the world watched the live transmission of the Apollo 11 moonwalk. The Apollo program also affectedenvironmental activismin the 1970s due to photos taken by the astronauts. The most well known includeEarthrise, taken byWilliam Anderson Apollo 8, andThe Blue Marble, taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts.The Blue Marblewas released during a surge in environmentalism, and became a symbol of the environmental movement as a depiction of Earth's frailty, vulnerability, and isolation amid the vast expanse of space. According toThe Economist, Apollo succeeded in accomplishing President Kennedy's goal of taking on the Soviet Union in theSpace Raceby accomplishing a singular and significant achievement, to demonstrate the superiority of thefree-market system. The publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy. Prior to Apollo 11's 40th anniversary in 2009, NASA searched for the original videotapes of the mission's live televised moonwalk. After an exhaustive three-year search, it was concluded that the tapes had probably been erased and reused. A new digitally remastered version of the best available broadcast television footage was released instead. Numerous documentary films cover the Apollo program and the Space Race, including: Some missions have beendramatized: The Apollo program has been the focus of several works of fiction, including:\n",

            "TheHubble Space Telescope(HSTorHubble) is aspace telescopethat was launched intolow Earth orbitin 1990 and remains in operation. It was not thefirst space telescope, but it is one of the largest and most versatile, renowned as a vital research tool and as a public relations boon forastronomy. The Hubble Space Telescope is named after astronomerEdwin Hubbleand is one ofNASA'sGreat Observatories. TheSpace Telescope Science Institute(STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while theGoddard Space Flight Center(GSFC) controls the spacecraft. Hubble features a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) mirror, and its five main instruments observe in theultraviolet,visible, andnear-infraredregions of theelectromagnetic spectrum. Hubble's orbit outside the distortion ofEarth's atmosphereallows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs inastrophysics, such asdetermining the rate of expansion of the universe. The Hubble Space Telescope was funded and built in the 1970s by NASA with contributions from theEuropean Space Agency. Its intended launch was in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the 1986Challengerdisaster. Hubble was launched onSTS-31in 1990, but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly, resulting inspherical aberrationthat compromised the telescope's capabilities. The optics were corrected to their intended quality by a servicing mission,STS-61, in 1993. Hubble is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five Space Shuttle missions repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. Thefifth missionwas initially canceled on safety grounds following theColumbiadisaster(2003), but afterNASA administratorMichael D. Griffinapproved it, the servicing mission was completed in 2009. Hubble completed 30 years of operation in April 2020and is predicted to last until 2030 to 2040. Hubble is the visible light telescope in NASA'sGreat Observatories program; other parts of the spectrum are covered by theCompton Gamma Ray Observatory, theChandra X-ray Observatory, and theSpitzer Space Telescope(which covers the infrared bands).The mid-IR-to-visible band successor to the Hubble telescope is theJames Webb Space Telescope(JWST), which was launched on December 25, 2021, with theNancy Grace Roman Space Telescopedue to follow in 2027. In 1923Hermann Oberth, considered a father of modern rocketry along withRobert H. GoddardandKonstantin Tsiolkovsky, publishedDie Rakete zu den Planetenräumen(\"The Rocket into Planetary Space\"), which mentioned how a telescope could be propelled intoEarthorbit by a rocket. The history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced to 1946, toastronomerLyman Spitzer's paper \"Astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory\".In it, he discussed the two main advantages that a space-based observatory would have over ground-based telescopes. First, theangular resolution(the smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished) would be limited only bydiffraction, rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere, which causes stars to twinkle, known to astronomers asseeing. At that time ground-based telescopes were limited to resolutions of 0.5–1.0arcseconds, compared to a theoretical diffraction-limited resolution of about 0.05 arcsec for an optical telescope with amirror2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) in diameter. Second, a space-based telescope could observeinfraredand ultraviolet light, which are strongly absorbed by theatmosphere of Earth. Spitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope.In 1962, a report by the U.S.National Academy of Sciencesrecommended development of aspace telescopeas part of thespace program, and in 1965, Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope. Also crucial was the work ofNancy Grace Roman, the \"Mother of Hubble\".Well before it became an officialNASAproject, she gave public lectures touting the scientific value of the telescope. After it was approved, she became the program scientist, setting up the steering committee in charge of making astronomer needs feasible to implementand writing testimony toCongressthroughout the 1970s to advocate continued funding of the telescope.Her work as project scientist helped set the standards for NASA's operation of large scientific projects. Space-based astronomy had begun on a very small scale followingWorld War II, as scientists made use of developments that had taken place inrockettechnology. The first ultravioletspectrumof theSunwas obtained in 1946,and NASA launched theOrbiting Solar Observatory(OSO) to obtain UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra in 1962.Anorbiting solar telescopewas launched in 1962 by the United Kingdom as part of theAriel programme, and in 1966 NASA launched the firstOrbiting Astronomical Observatory(OAO) mission. OAO-1's battery failed after three days, terminating the mission. It was followed byOrbiting Astronomical Observatory 2(OAO-2), which carried out ultraviolet observations ofstarsandgalaxiesfrom its launch in 1968 until 1972, well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year. The OSO and OAO missions demonstrated the important role space-based observations could play in astronomy. In 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-basedreflecting telescopewith a mirror 3 m (9.8 ft) in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for crewed maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusableSpace Shuttleindicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available. The continuing success of the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, and the other to determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. TheU.S. Congressquestioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974,public spendingcuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project. In 1977, then NASA AdministratorJames C. Fletcherproposed a token $5million for Hubble in NASA's budget. Then NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science,Noel Hinners, instead cut all funding for Hubble, gambling that this would galvanize the scientific community into fighting for full funding. As Hinners recalls: It was clear that year that we weren't going to be able to get a full-up start. There was some opposition on [Capitol] Hill to getting a new start on [Hubble]. It was driven, in large part as I recall, by the budget situation. Jim Fletcher proposed that we put in five million as a placeholder. I didn't like that idea. It was, in today's vernacular, a \"sop\" to the astronomy community. \"There's something in there, so all is well\". I figured in my own little head that to get that community energized we'd be better off zeroing it out. Then they would say, \"Whoa, we're in deep trouble\", and it would marshal the troops. So I advocated that we not put anything in. I don't remember any of the detailed discussions or whether there were any, but Jim went along with that so we zeroed it out. It had, from my perspective, the desired impact of stimulating the astronomy community to renew their efforts on the lobbying front. While I like to think in hindsight it was a brilliant political move, I'm not sure I thought it through all that well. It was something that was spur of the moment. [...] five million would let them think that all is well anyway, but it's not. So let's give them a message. My own thinking, get them stimulated to get into action. Zeroing it out would certainly give that message. I think it was as simple as that. Didn't talk to anybody else about doing it first, just, \"Let's go do that\". Voila, it worked. Don't know whether I'd do that again. The political ploy worked. In response to Hubble being zeroed out of NASA's budget, a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers. Many astronomers metcongressmenandsenatorsin person, and large-scale letter-writing campaigns were organized. TheNational Academy of Sciencespublished a report emphasizing the need for a space telescope, and eventually, the Senate agreed to half the budget that had originally been approved by Congress. The funding issues led to a reduction in the scale of the project, with the proposed mirror diameter reduced from 3 m to 2.4 m, both to cut costsand to allow a more compact and effective configuration for the telescope hardware. A proposed precursor 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) space telescope to test the systems to be used on the main satellite was dropped, and budgetary concerns also prompted collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA agreed to provide funding and supply one of the first generation instruments for the telescope, as well as thesolar cellsthat would power it, and staff to work on the telescope in the United States, in return for European astronomers being guaranteed at least 15% of the observing time on the telescope.Congress eventually approved funding of $36million for 1978, and the design of the LST began in earnest, aiming for a launch date of 1983.In 1983, the telescope was named afterEdwin Hubble,who confirmed one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th century, made byGeorges Lemaître, that theuniverseisexpanding. Once the Space Telescope project had been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions.Marshall Space Flight Center(MSFC) was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, whileGoddard Space Flight Centerwas given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission.MSFC commissioned the optics companyPerkin-Elmerto design and build theoptical telescope assembly(OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope.Lockheedwas commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed. Optically, the HST is aCassegrain reflectorofRitchey–Chrétien design, as are most large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, is known for good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes that are hard to fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to anaccuracyof about a tenth of thewavelengthofvisible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to bediffraction limitedto take full advantage of the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10 nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light.On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum infrared performance in mind, e.g. the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope. Perkin-Elmer (PE) intended to use custom-built and extremely sophisticatedcomputer-controlled polishing machinesto grind the mirror to the required shape.However, in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract toKodakto construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques.(The team of Kodak andItekalso bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later causedproblems.)The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at theNational Air and Space Museum.An Itek mirror built as part of the effort is now used in the 2.4 m telescope at theMagdalena Ridge Observatory. Construction of the Perkin-Elmer mirror began in 1979, starting with a blank manufactured byCorningfrom their ultra-low expansion glass. To keep the mirror's weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates, each 25 mm (0.98 in) thick, sandwiching ahoneycomblattice. Perkin-Elmer simulatedmicrogravityby supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force.This ensured the mirror's final shape would be correct and to specification when deployed. Mirror polishing continued until May 1981. NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin-Elmer's managerial structure, and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget. To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and moved the launch date of the telescope to October 1984.The mirror was completed by the end of 1981; it was washed using 9,100 L (2,000 imp gal; 2,400 US gal) of hot,deionized waterand then received a reflective coating of 65‑nm‑thickaluminumand a protective coating of 25‑nm‑thickmagnesium fluoride. Doubts continued to be expressed about Perkin-Elmer's competence on a project of this importance, as their budget and timescale for producing the rest of the OTA continued to inflate. In response to a schedule described as \"unsettled and changing daily\", NASA postponed the launch date of the telescope until April 1985. Perkin-Elmer's schedules continued to slip at a rate of about one month per quarter, and at times delays reached one day for each day of work. NASA was forced to postpone the launch date until March and then September 1986. By this time, the total project budget had risen to $1.175billion. The spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight into the darkness of Earth'sshadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud ofmulti-layer insulationkeeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell in which the telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, agraphite-epoxyframe keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned.Because graphite composites arehygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space. As well as electrical power systems, thePointing Control Systemcontrols HST orientation using five types of sensors (magnetic sensors, optical sensors, and six gyroscopes) and two types ofactuators(reaction wheelsandmagnetic torquers). While construction of the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than the construction of the OTA, Lockheed experienced some budget and schedule slippage, and by the summer 1985, construction of the spacecraft was 30% over budget and three months behind schedule. An MSFC report said Lockheed tended to rely on NASA directions rather than take their own initiative in the construction. The two initial, primary computers on the HST were the 1.25MHzDF-224system, built by Rockwell Autonetics, which contained three redundant CPUs, and two redundantNSSC-1(NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer, Model 1) systems, developed byWestinghouseand GSFC usingdiode–transistor logic(DTL). A co-processor for the DF-224 was added during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, which consisted of two redundant strings of an Intel-based 80386 processor with an 80387 math co-processor.The DF-224 and its 386 co-processor were replaced by a 25MHz Intel-based 80486 processor system duringServicing Mission 3Ain 1999.The new computer is 20 times faster, with six times more memory, than theDF-224it replaced. It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages. Additionally, some of the science instruments and components had their own embedded microprocessor-based control systems. The MATs (Multiple Access Transponder) components, MAT-1 and MAT-2, use Hughes Aircraft CDP1802CD microprocessors.TheWide Field and Planetary Camera(WFPC) also used anRCA 1802 microprocessor(or possibly the older 1801 version).The WFPC-1 was replaced by theWFPC-2during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, which was then replaced by theWide Field Camera 3(WFC3) during Servicing Mission 4 in 2009. The upgrade extended Hubble's capability of seeing deeper into the universe and providing images in three broad regions of the spectrum. When launched, the HST carried five scientific instruments: the Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC), Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS), High Speed Photometer (HSP), Faint Object Camera (FOC) and the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS). WF/PC used a radial instrument bay, and the other four instruments were each installed in an axial instrument bay. WF/PC was a high-resolution imaging device primarily intended for optical observations. It was built by NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory, and incorporated a set of 48filtersisolatingspectral linesof particular astrophysical interest. The instrument contained eightcharge-coupled device(CCD) chips divided between two cameras, each using four CCDs. Each CCD has a resolution of 0.64 megapixels.The wide field camera (WFC) covered a large angular field at the expense of resolution, while the planetary camera (PC) took images at a longer effectivefocal lengththan the WF chips, giving it a greater magnification. TheGoddard High Resolution Spectrograph(GHRS) was aspectrographdesigned to operate in the ultraviolet. It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and could achieve aspectral resolutionof 90,000.Also optimized for ultraviolet observations were the FOC and FOS, which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on Hubble. Rather than CCDs, these three instruments usedphoton-countingdigiconsas their detectors. The FOC was constructed by ESA, while theUniversity of California, San Diego, andMartin Marietta Corporationbuilt the FOS. The final instrument was the HSP, designed and built at theUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison. It was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations ofvariable starsand other astronomical objects varying in brightness. It could take up to 100,000 measurements per second with aphotometricaccuracy of about 2% or better. HST's guidance system can also be used as a scientific instrument. Its threeFine Guidance Sensors(FGS) are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation, but can also be used to carry out extremely accurateastrometry; measurements accurate to within 0.0003 arcseconds have been achieved. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers. STScI is operated by theAssociation of Universities for Research in Astronomy(AURA) and is physically located inBaltimore, Marylandon the Homewood campus ofJohns Hopkins University, one of the 39 U.S. universities and seven international affiliates that make up the AURA consortium. STScI was established in 1981after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. NASA had wanted to keep this function in-house, but scientists wanted it to be based in anacademicestablishment.TheSpace Telescope European Coordinating Facility(ST-ECF), established atGarching bei MünchennearMunichin 1984, provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011, when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre. One complex task that falls to STScI is scheduling observations for the telescope.Hubble is in a low-Earth orbit to enable servicing missions, which results in most astronomical targets beingoccultedby the Earth for slightly less than half of each orbit. Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through theSouth Atlantic Anomalydue to elevatedradiationlevels, and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun (precluding observations ofMercury), Moon and Earth. The solar avoidance angle is about 50°, to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA. Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the FGSs, and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments. If the FGSs are turned off, the Moon and Earth can be observed. Earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat-fields for the WFPC1 instrument. There is a so-called continuous viewing zone (CVZ), within roughly 24° of Hubble'sorbital poles, in which targets are notoccultedfor long periods. Due to theprecessionof the orbit, the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks. Because thelimbof the Earth is always within about 30° of regions within the CVZ, the brightness of scatteredearthshinemay be elevated for long periods during CVZ observations. Hubble orbits in low Earth orbit at an altitude of approximately 540 kilometers (340 mi) and an inclination of 28.5°.The position along its orbit changes over time in a way that is not accurately predictable. The density of the upper atmosphere varies according to many factors, and this means Hubble's predicted position for six weeks' time could be in error by up to 4,000 km (2,500 mi). Observation schedules are typically finalized only a few days in advance, as a longer lead time would mean there was a chance the target would be unobservable by the time it was due to be observed.Engineering support for HST is provided by NASA and contractor personnel at the Goddard Space Flight Center inGreenbelt, Maryland, 48 km (30 mi) south of the STScI. Hubble's operation is monitored 24 hours per day by four teams of flight controllers who make up Hubble's Flight Operations Team. By January 1986, the planned launch date for Hubble that October looked feasible, but theChallengerdisasterbrought the U.S. space program to a halt, grounded the Shuttle fleet, and forced the launch to be postponed for several years. During this delay the telescope was kept in a clean room, powered up and purged with nitrogen, until a launch could be rescheduled. This costly situation (about $6million per month) pushed the overall costs of the project higher. However, this delay allowed time for engineers to perform extensive tests, swap out a possibly failure-prone battery, and make other improvements.Furthermore, the ground software needed to control Hubble was not ready in 1986, and was barely ready by the 1990 launch.Following the resumption of shuttle flights,Space ShuttleDiscoverysuccessfully launched the Hubble on April 24, 1990, as part of the STS-31 mission. At launch, NASA had spent approximately $4.7 billion in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars on the project.Hubble's cumulative costs are estimated to be about $11.3billion in 2015 dollars, which include all subsequent servicing costs, but not ongoing operations, making it the most expensive science mission in NASA history. Hubble accommodates five science instruments at a given time, plus theFine Guidance Sensors, which are mainly used for aiming the telescope but are occasionally used for scientificastrometrymeasurements. Early instruments were replaced with more advanced ones during the Shuttle servicing missions. COSTAR was a corrective optics device rather than a science instrument, but occupied one of the four axial instrument bays. Since the final servicing mission in 2009, the four active instruments have been ACS, COS, STIS and WFC3. NICMOS is kept in hibernation, but may be revived if WFC3 were to fail in the future. Of the former instruments, three (COSTAR, FOS and WFPC2) are displayed in the SmithsonianNational Air and Space Museum.The FOC is in theDorniermuseum, Germany.The HSP is in the Space Place at theUniversity of Wisconsin–Madison.The first WFPC was dismantled, and some components were then re-used in WFC3. Within weeks of the launch of the telescope, the returned images indicated a serious problem with the optical system. Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images ofpoint sourcesspread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond, instead of having apoint spread function(PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1arcseconds(485nrad) in diameter, as had been specified in the design criteria. Analysis of the flawed images revealed that the primary mirror had been polished to the wrong shape. Although it was believed to be one of the most preciselyfiguredoptical mirrors ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers,the outer perimeter was too flat by about 2200 nanometers (about1⁄450mm or1⁄11000inch).This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirrorfocuseson a different point from the light reflecting off its center. The effect of the mirror flaw on scientific observations depended on the particular observation. The core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was affected only through a sensitivity loss; however, the loss of light to the large, out-of-focus halo severely reduced the usefulness of the telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant nearly all the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects.This led politicians to question NASA's competence, scientists to rue the cost which could have gone to more productive endeavors, and comedians to make jokes about NASA and the telescope. In the 1991 comedyThe Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear, in a scene where historical disasters are displayed, Hubble is pictured with theTitanicand theHindenburg.Nonetheless, during the first three years of the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets.The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticatedimage processingtechniques such asdeconvolution. A commission headed byLew Allen, director of theJet Propulsion Laboratory, was established to determine how the error could have arisen. The Allen Commission found that a reflectivenull corrector, a testing device used to achieve a properly shaped non-spherical mirror, had been incorrectly assembled. (One lens was out of position by 1.3 mm (0.051 in).)During the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror,Perkin-Elmeranalyzed its surface with two conventional refractive null correctors. However, for the final manufacturing step (figuring), they switched to the custom-built reflective null corrector, designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances. The incorrect assembly of this device resulted in the mirror being ground very precisely but to the wrong shape. During fabrication, a few tests using conventional null correctors correctly reportedspherical aberration. But these results were dismissed, thus missing the opportunity to catch the error, because the reflective null corrector was considered more accurate. The commission blamed the failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument. Many feared that Hubble would be abandoned.The design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions, and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem that could be applied at the first servicing mission, scheduled for 1993. While Kodak had ground a back-up mirror for Hubble, it would have been impossible to replace the mirror in orbit, and too expensive and time-consuming to bring the telescope back to Earth for a refit. Instead, the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense, to be added to the telescope at the servicing mission, effectively acting as \"spectacles\" to correct the spherical aberration. The first step was a precise characterization of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that theconic constantof the mirror as built was−1.01390±0.0002, instead of the intended−1.00230.The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the mirror, as well as by analyzinginterferogramsobtained during ground testing of the mirror. Because of the way the HST's instruments were designed, two different sets of correctors were required. The design of the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, already planned to replace the existing WF/PC, included relay mirrors to direct light onto the four separate charge-coupled device (CCD) chips making up its two cameras. An inverse error built into their surfaces could completely cancel the aberration of the primary. However, the other instruments lacked any intermediate surfaces that could be configured in this way, and so required an external correction device. TheCorrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement(COSTAR) system was designed to correct the spherical aberration for light focused at the FOC, FOS, and GHRS. It consists of two mirrors in the light path with one ground to correct the aberration.To fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope, one of the other instruments had to be removed, and astronomers selected the High Speed Photometer to be sacrificed.By 2002, all the original instruments requiring COSTAR had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective optics.COSTAR was then removed and returned to Earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.The area previously used by COSTAR is now occupied by theCosmic Origins Spectrograph. Hubble was designed to accommodate regular servicing and equipment upgrades while in orbit. Instruments and limited life items were designed asorbital replacement units.Five servicing missions (SM 1, 2, 3A, 3B, and 4) were flown by NASASpace Shuttles, the first in December 1993 and the last in May 2009.Servicing missions were delicate operations that began with maneuvering to intercept the telescope in orbit and carefully retrieving it with the shuttle'smechanical arm. The necessary work was then carried out in multiple tetheredspacewalksover a period of four to five days. After a visual inspection of the telescope, astronauts conducted repairs, replaced failed or degraded components, upgraded equipment, and installed new instruments. Once work was completed, the telescope was redeployed, typically after boosting to a higher orbit to address theorbital decaycaused by atmosphericdrag. The first Hubble servicing mission was scheduled for 1993 before the mirror problem was discovered. It assumed greater importance, as the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics; failure would have resulted in either abandoning Hubble or accepting its permanent disability. Other components failed before the mission, causing the repair cost to rise to $500million (not including the cost of the shuttle flight). A successful repair would help demonstrate the viability of buildingSpace Station Alpha. STS-49in 1992 demonstrated the difficulty of space work. While its rescue ofIntelsat 603received praise, the astronauts had taken possibly reckless risks in doing so. Neither the rescue nor the unrelated assembly of prototype space station components occurred as the astronauts had trained, causing NASA to reassess planning and training, including for the Hubble repair. The agency assigned to the missionStory Musgrave(who had worked on satellite repair procedures since 1976) and six other experienced astronauts, including two from STS-49. The first mission director sinceProject Apollo[clarification needed]would coordinate a crew with 16 previous shuttle flights. The astronauts were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools. Heat had been the problem on prior spacewalks, which occurred in sunlight. Hubble needed to be repaired out of sunlight. Musgrave discovered during vacuum training, seven months before the mission, that spacesuit gloves did not sufficiently protect against the cold of space. AfterSTS-57confirmed the issue in orbit, NASA quickly changed equipment, procedures, and flight plan. Seven total mission simulations occurred before launch, the most thorough preparation in shuttle history. No complete Hubble mockup existed, so the astronauts studied many separate models (including one at the Smithsonian) and mentally combined their varying and contradictory details. Service Mission 1 flew aboardEndeavourin December 1993, and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over ten days. Most importantly, theHigh Speed Photometerwas replaced with theCOSTARcorrective optics package, and WF/PC was replaced with theWide Field and Planetary Camera 2(WFPC2) with an internal optical correction system. Thesolar arraysand their drive electronics were also replaced, as well as four gyroscopes in the telescope pointing system, two electrical control units and other electrical components, and two magnetometers. The onboard computers were upgraded with addedcoprocessors, and Hubble's orbit was boosted. On January 13, 1994, NASA declared the mission a complete success and showed the first sharper images.The mission was one of the most complex performed to that date, involving five longextra-vehicular activityperiods. Its success was a boon for NASA, as well as for the astronomers who now had a more capable space telescope. Servicing Mission 2, flown byDiscoveryin February 1997, replaced the GHRS and the FOS with theSpace Telescope Imaging Spectrograph(STIS) and theNear Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer(NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with a new Solid State Recorder, and repaired thermal insulation.NICMOS contained aheat sinkof solidnitrogento reduce thethermal noisefrom the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpectedthermal expansionresulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about two years. Servicing Mission 3A, flown byDiscovery, took place in December 1999, and was a split-off from Servicing Mission3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed. The fourth failed a few weeks before the mission, rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations. The mission replaced all sixgyroscopes, replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery overcharging, and replaced thermal insulation blankets. Servicing Mission 3B flown byColumbiain March 2002 saw the installation of a new instrument, with the FOC (which, except for the Fine Guidance Sensors when used for astrometry, was the last of the original instruments) being replaced by theAdvanced Camera for Surveys(ACS). This meant COSTAR was no longer required, since all new instruments had built-in correction for the main mirror aberration.The mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed-cycle coolerand replaced the solar arrays for the second time, providing 30 percent more power. Plans called for Hubble to be serviced in February 2005, but theColumbiadisasterin 2003, in which the orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects to the Hubble program and other NASA missions. NASA AdministratorSean O'Keefedecided all future shuttle missions had to be able to reach the safe haven of theInternational Space Stationshould in-flight problems develop. As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the space station during the same mission, future crewed service missions were canceled.This decision was criticized by numerous astronomers who felt Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk.HST's planned successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), by 2004 was not expected to launch until at least 2011. JWST was eventually launched in December 2021.A gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST.The consideration that JWST will not be located in low Earth orbit, and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure, only made concerns more acute. On the other hand, NASA officials were concerned that continuing to service Hubble would consume funds from other programs and delay the JWST. In January 2004, O'Keefe said he would review his decision to cancel the final servicing mission to HST, due to public outcry and requests from Congress for NASA to look for a way to save it. The National Academy of Sciences convened an official panel, which recommended in July 2004 that the HST should be preserved despite the apparent risks. Their report urged \"NASA should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope\".In August 2004, O'Keefe asked Goddard Space Flight Center to prepare a detailed proposal for a robotic service mission. These plans were later canceled, the robotic mission being described as \"not feasible\".In late 2004, several Congressional members, led by SenatorBarbara Mikulski, held public hearings and carried on a fight with much public support (including thousands of letters from school children across the U.S.) to get the Bush Administration and NASA to reconsider the decision to drop plans for a Hubble rescue mission. The nomination in April 2005 of a new NASA Administrator,Michael D. Griffin, changed the situation, as Griffin stated he would consider a crewed servicing mission.Soon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a crewed Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions. In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission byAtlantiswas scheduled for October 2008. Hubble's main data-handling unit failed in September 2008,halting all reporting of scientific data until its back-up was brought online on October 25, 2008.Since a failure of the backup unit would leave the HST helpless, the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit. Servicing Mission 4 (SM4), flown byAtlantisin May 2009, was the last scheduled shuttle mission for HST.SM4 installed the replacement data-handling unit, repaired the ACS and STIS systems, installed improvednickel–hydrogen batteries, and replaced other components including all six gyroscopes. SM4 also installed two new observation instruments: Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and theCosmic Origins Spectrograph(COS)and theSoft Capture and Rendezvous System, which will enable the future rendezvous, capture, and safe disposal of Hubble by either a crewed or robotic mission.Except for the ACS'sHigh Resolution Channel, which could not be repaired and was disabled,the work accomplished during SM4 rendered the telescope fully functional. Since the start of the program, a number of research projects have been carried out, some of them almost solely with Hubble, others coordinated facilities such asChandra X-ray ObservatoryandESO'sVery Large Telescope. Although the Hubble observatory is nearing the end of its life, there are still major projects scheduled for it. One example is the current (2022) ULLYSES project (Ultraviolet Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards) which will last for three years to observe a set of high- and low-mass young stars and will shed light on star formation and composition. Another is the OPAL project (Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy), which is focussed on understanding the evolution and dynamics of the atmosphere of the outer planets (such as Jupiter and Uranus) by making baseline observations over an extended period. In an August 2013 press release,CANDELSwas referred to as \"the largest project in the history of Hubble\". The survey \"aims to explore galactic evolution in the early Universe, and the first seeds of cosmic structure at less than one billion years after the Big Bang.\"The CANDELS project site describes the survey's goals as the following: The Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution from z = 8 to 1.5 via deep imaging of more than 250,000 galaxies with WFC3/IR and ACS. It will also find the first Type Ia SNe beyond z > 1.5 and establish their accuracy as standard candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected; each has multi-wavelength data from Spitzer and other facilities, and has extensive spectroscopy of the brighter galaxies. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to 109solar masses out to z ~ 8. The program, officially named \"Hubble Deep Fields Initiative 2012\", is aimed to advance the knowledge of earlygalaxy formationby studying high-redshift galaxies inblank fieldswith the help ofgravitational lensingto see the \"faintest galaxies in the distant universe\".The Frontier Fields web page describes the goals of the program being: TheCosmic Evolution Survey(COSMOS)is an astronomical survey designed to probe the formation and evolution of galaxies as a function of both cosmic time (redshift) and the local galaxy environment. The survey covers a two square degree equatorial field with spectroscopy and X-ray to radio imaging by most of the major space-based telescopes and a number of large ground based telescopes,making it a key focus region of extragalactic astrophysics. COSMOS was launched in 2006 as the largest project pursued by the Hubble Space Telescope at the time, and still is the largest continuous area of sky covered for the purposes of mapping deep space inblank fields, 2.5 times the area of the moon on the sky and 17 times larger than the largest of the CANDELS regions. The COSMOS scientific collaboration that was forged from the initial COSMOS survey is the largest and longest-running extragalactic collaboration, known for its collegiality and openness. The study of galaxies in their environment can be done only with large areas of the sky, larger than a half square degree.More than two million galaxies are detected, spanning 90% of the age of theUniverse. The COSMOS collaboration is led byCaitlin Casey,Jeyhan Kartaltepe, and Vernesa Smolcic and involves more than 200 scientists in a dozen countries. TheCluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble(CLASH) was a Treasury Program from 2010 to 2013 conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope to observe 25 massive galaxy clusters by using gravitational lensing. CLASH aimed to examine the distribution of dark matter and dark energy in massive galaxy clusters with the new instruments installed in 2009. Imagery showing the effects of gravitational lensing is one means of detecting dark matter and dark energy, and CLASH focused on trying to gain a better understanding of both mysterious topics. ThePanchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury and Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Southern Treasury(PHAT and PHAST) were observations done by Hubble from July 2010 to October 2013 to map the northern half of theAndromeda Galaxyand from December 2021 to January 2024 to map the southern half. Andromeda is the nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way Galaxy and Hubble created the highest resolution and most detailedphotomosaicever of Andromeda. Two hundred million stars can be seen in this combined image of both Treasury Programs out of a total one trillion stars in Andromeda. Each star looks like a grain of sand. The northern half, PHAT, was mapped in near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelengths in 828 orbits and was released in January 2015. The southern half, PHAST, was mapped in near-ultraviolet and visible wavelengths in 195 orbits and was released in January 2025. Observing Andromeda in this detail is the best alternative to observing the Milky Way Galaxy because Earth is within the Milky Way and cannot observe most of the Milky Way due to thegalaxy itself blocking observationsof 20% of the sky and most of the galaxy. To achieve this mosaic 1,023 Hubble orbits were needed. The mosaic image is made up of at least 2.5billion pixels. Anyone can apply for time on the telescope; there are no restrictions on nationality or academic affiliation, but funding for analysis is available only to U.S. institutions.Competition for time on the telescope is intense, with about one-fifth of the proposals submitted in each cycle earning time on the schedule. Calls for proposals are issued roughly annually, with time allocated for a cycle lasting about one year. Proposals are divided into several categories; \"general observer\" proposals are the most common, covering routine observations. \"Snapshot observations\" are those in which targets require only 45 minutes or less of telescope time, including overheads such as acquiring the target. Snapshot observations are used to fill in gaps in the telescope schedule that cannot be filled by regular general observer programs. Astronomers may make \"Target of Opportunity\" proposals, in which observations are scheduled if a transient event covered by the proposal occurs during the scheduling cycle. In addition, up to 10% of the telescope time is designated \"director's discretionary\" (DD) time. Astronomers can apply to use DD time at any time of year, and it is typically awarded for study of unexpected transient phenomena such as supernovae. Other uses of DD time have included the observations that led to views of the Hubble Deep Field and Hubble Ultra Deep Field, and in the first four cycles of telescope time, observations that were carried out by amateur astronomers. In 2012, the ESA held a contest for public image processing of Hubble data to encourage the discovery of \"hidden treasures\" in the raw Hubble data. The first director of STScI,Riccardo Giacconi, announced in 1986 that he intended to devote some of his director discretionary time to allowing amateur astronomers to use the telescope. The total time to be allocated was only a few hours per cycle but excited great interest among amateur astronomers. Proposals for amateur time were stringently reviewed by a committee of amateur astronomers, and time was awarded only to proposals that were deemed to have genuine scientific merit, did not duplicate proposals made by professionals, and required the unique capabilities of the space telescope. Thirteen amateur astronomers were awarded time on the telescope, with observations being carried out between 1990 and 1997.One such study was \"Transition Comets – UV Search for OH\". The first proposal, \"A Hubble Space Telescope Study of Posteclipse Brightening and Albedo Changes on Io\", was published inIcarus,a journal devoted to solar system studies. A second study from another group of amateurs was also published inIcarus.After that time, however, budget reductions at STScI made the support of work by amateur astronomers untenable, and no additional amateur programs have been carried out. Regular Hubble proposals still include findings or discovered objects by amateurs andcitizen scientists. These observations are often in a collaboration with professional astronomers. One of the earliest such observations is theGreat White Spotof 1990on planet Saturn, discovered by amateur astronomer S. Wilberand observed by HST under a proposal by J. Westphal (Caltech).Later professional-amateur observations by Hubble include discoveries by theGalaxy Zooproject, such asVoorwerpjesandGreen Pea galaxies.The \"Gems of the Galaxies\" program is based on a list of objects byGalaxy Zoovolunteers that was shortened with the help of an online vote.Additionally there are observations ofminor planetsdiscovered by amateur astronomers, such as2I/Borisovand changes in the atmosphere of thegas giantsJupiter and Saturn or theice giantsUranus and Neptune.In the pro-am collaborationbackyard worldsthe HST was used to observe aplanetary mass object, calledWISE J0830+2837. The non-detection by the HST helped to classify this peculiar object. In the early 1980s, NASA and STScI convened four panels to discuss key projects. These were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time, which would be explicitly dedicated to each project. This guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early, in case the telescope failed sooner than expected. The panels identified three such projects: 1) a study of the nearby intergalactic medium using quasarabsorption linesto determine the properties of theintergalactic mediumand the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies;2) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being usedand 3) a project to determine theHubble constantwithin ten percent by reducing the errors, both external and internal, in the calibration of the distance scale. Hubble has helped resolve some long-standing problems in astronomy, while also raising new questions. Some results have required newtheoriesto explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances toCepheid variablestars more accurately than ever before, and thusconstrain the valueof theHubble constant, the measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically haderrorsof up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in theVirgo Clusterand other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques.The estimated age of the universe is now 13.7billion years. (Before the Hubble Telescope it was ten to twenty billion.) Astronomers from theHigh-z Supernova Search Teamand theSupernova Cosmology Projectused ground-based telescopes and HST to observe distantsupernovaeand uncovered evidence that, far from decelerating under the influence ofgravity, the expansion of the universe is insteadaccelerating. Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awardedNobel Prizesfor their discovery.The cause of this acceleration remains poorly understood;the term used for the currently-unknown cause isdark energy, signifying that it is dark (unable to be directly seen and detected) to our current scientific instruments. The high-resolution spectra and images provided by the HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence ofblack holesin the center of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would be found at the centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies.The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. A unique window on the Universe enabled by Hubble are theHubble Deep Field,Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, andHubble Extreme Deep Fieldimages, which used Hubble's unmatched sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths. The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, thereby providing information about the early Universe, and have accordingly generated a wealth of scientific papers. The Wide Field Camera3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery of some of the most distant objects yet discovered, such asMACS0647-JD. The non-standard objectSCP 06F6was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in February 2006. On March 3, 2016, researchers using Hubble data announced the discovery of the farthest confirmed galaxy to date:GN-z11, which Hubble observed as it existed roughly 400million years after the Big Bang.The Hubble observations occurred on February 11, 2015, and April 3, 2015, as part of theCANDELS/GOODS-North surveys. The collision ofComet Shoemaker-Levy 9withJupiterin 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers, coming just a few months after Servicing Mission1 had restored Hubble's optical performance. Hubble images of theplanetwere sharper than any taken since the passage ofVoyager 2in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the collision of a large comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries. In March 2015, researchers announced that measurements of aurorae aroundGanymede, one of Jupiter's moons, revealed that it has a subsurface ocean. Using Hubble to study the motion of its aurorae, the researchers determined that a large saltwater ocean was helping to suppress the interaction between Jupiter's magnetic field and that of Ganymede. The ocean is estimated to be 100 km (60 mi) deep, trapped beneath a 150 km (90 mi) ice crust. HST has also been used to study objects in the outer reaches of the Solar System, including the dwarf planetsPluto,Eris,andSedna.During June and July 2012, U.S. astronomers using Hubble discoveredStyx, a tiny fifth moon orbiting Pluto. From June to August 2015, Hubble was used tosearchfor aKuiper beltobject (KBO) target for theNew HorizonsKuiper Belt Extended Mission (KEM) when similar searches with ground telescopes failed to find a suitable target.This resulted in the discovery of at least five new KBOs, including the eventual KEM target,486958 Arrokoth, thatNew Horizonsperformed a close fly-by of on January 1, 2019. In April 2022 NASA announced that astronomers were able to use images from HST to determine the size of the nucleus of cometC/2014 UN271 (Bernardinelli–Bernstein), which is the largest icy comet nucleus ever seen by astronomers. The nucleus of C/2014 UN271 has an estimated mass of fifty trillion tons which is fifty times the mass of other known comets in the Solar System. On December 11, 2015, Hubble captured an image of the first-ever predicted reappearance of a supernova, dubbed \"Refsdal\", which was calculated using different mass models of a galaxy cluster whose gravity iswarpingthe supernova's light. The supernova was previously seen in November 2014 behind galaxy clusterMACS J1149.5+2223as part of Hubble's Frontier Fields program. The light from the cluster took roughly five billion years to reach Earth, while the light from the supernova behind it took five billion more years than that, as measured by their respectiveredshifts. Because of the gravitational effect of the galaxy cluster, four images of the supernova appeared instead of one, an example of anEinstein cross. Based on early lens models, a fifth image was predicted to reappear by the end of 2015.Refsdal reappeared as predicted in 2015. In March 2019, observations from Hubble and data from the European Space Agency'sGaiaspace observatory were combined to determine that the mass of theMilky Way Galaxyis approximately 1.5trillion times the mass of the Sun, a value intermediate between prior estimates. Other discoveries made with Hubble data include proto-planetary disks (proplyds) in theOrion Nebula;evidence for the presence ofextrasolar planetsaround Sun-like stars;and the optical counterparts of the still-mysteriousgamma-ray bursts.Usinggravitational lensing, Hubble observed a galaxy designatedMACS 2129-1approximately ten billion lightyears from Earth. MACS 2129-1 subverted expectations about galaxies in which new star formation had ceased, a significant result for understanding the formation ofelliptical galaxies. In 2022 Hubble detected the light of the farthest individual star ever seen to date. The star,WHL0137-LS(nicknamedEarendel), existed within the first billion years after theBig Bang. It will be observed by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to confirm Earendel is indeed a star. Many objective measures show the positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy. As of 2025, over 22,000papersbased on Hubble data have been published in peer-reviewed journals,and countless more have appeared in conferenceproceedings. Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have nocitations, while only two percent of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data. Although the HST has clearly helped astronomical research, its financial cost has been large. A study on the relative astronomical benefits of different sizes of telescopes found that while papers based on HST data generate 15 times as many citations as a 4 m (13 ft) ground-based telescope such as theWilliam Herschel Telescope, the HST costs about 100 times as much to build and maintain. Deciding between building ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based techniques such asaperture masking interferometryhad obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble.Since then, advances inadaptive opticshave extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can correct only a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wider field.Moreover, Hubble can image more faint objects, since ground-based telescopes are affected by the background of scattered light created by the Earth's atmosphere. In addition to its scientific results, Hubble has also made significant contributions toaerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit (LEO). These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior ofgraphite compositestructures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing,radiation damageto electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior ofmulti-layer insulation.One lesson learned was that gyroscopes assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyroscopes are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.Another is that optical surfaces in LEO can have surprisingly long lifetimes; Hubble was only expected to last 15 years before the mirror became unusable, but after 14 years there was no measureable degradation.Finally, Hubble servicing missions, particularly those that serviced components not designed for in-space maintenance, have contributed towards the development of new tools and techniques for on-orbit repair. Hubble data was initially stored on the spacecraft. When launched, the storage facilities were old-fashioned reel-to-reeltape drives, but these were replaced bysolid statedata storage facilities during servicing missions2 and 3A. About twice daily, the Hubble Space Telescope radios data to a satellite in thegeosynchronousTracking and Data Relay Satellite System(TDRSS), which then downlinks the science data to one of two 60-foot (18-meter) diameter high-gain microwave antennas located at theWhite Sands Test FacilityinWhite Sands, New Mexico.From there they are sent to the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center, and finally to the Space Telescope Science Institute for archiving.Each week, HST downlinks approximately 140 gigabits of data. All images from Hubble aremonochromaticgrayscale, taken through a variety of filters, each passing specific wavelengths of light, and incorporated in each camera. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also createfalse-colorversions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue. All Hubble data is eventually made available via theMikulski Archive for Space TelescopesatSTScI,CADCandESA/ESAC.Data is usually proprietary (available only to theprincipal investigator(PI) and astronomers designated by the PI) for twelve months after being taken. The PI can apply to the director of the STScI to extend or reduce the proprietary period in some circumstances. Observations made on Director's Discretionary Time are exempt from the proprietary period, and are released to the public immediately. Calibration data such as flat fields anddark framesare also publicly available straight away. All data in the archive is in theFITSformat, which is suitable for astronomical analysis but not for public use.TheHubble Heritage Projectprocesses and releases to the public a small selection of the most striking images inJPEGandTIFFformats. Astronomical data taken with CCDs must undergo several calibration steps before they are suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This \"on-the-fly\" processing means large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as \"pipeline reduction\", and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used. Hubble data can be analyzed using many different packages. STScI maintains the custom-madeSpace Telescope Science Data Analysis System(STSDAS) software, which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files, as well as many other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data. The software runs as a module ofIRAF, a popular astronomical data reduction program. NASA considered it important for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution oftaxpayersto its construction and operational costs.After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images. Several initiatives have helped to keep the public informed about Hubble activities.\n",
            "In the United States,outreachefforts are coordinated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Office for Public Outreach, which was established in 2000 to ensure that U.S. taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program. To that end, STScI operates the HubbleSite.org website. TheHubble Heritage Project, operating out of the STScI, provides the public with high-quality images of the most interesting and striking objects observed. The Heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers, as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy, and emphasizes theaestheticnature of Hubble images. The Heritage Project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which, for scientific reasons, may not have images taken at enough wavelengths to construct a full-color image. Since 1999, the leading Hubble outreach group in Europe has been theHubble European Space Agency Information Centre(HEIC).This office was established at theSpace Telescope European Coordinating Facilityin Munich, Germany. HEIC's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency. The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. ESA produces educational material, including avideocastseries called Hubblecast designed to share world-class scientific news with the public. The Hubble Space Telescope has won two Space Achievement Awards from theSpace Foundation, for its outreach activities, in 2001 and 2010. A replica of the Hubble Space Telescope is displayed on the courthouse lawn inMarshfield, Missouri, the hometown of namesake Edwin P. Hubble. The Hubble Space Telescope celebrated its 20th anniversary in space on April 24, 2010. To commemorate the occasion, NASA, ESA, and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) released an image from theCarina Nebula. To commemorate Hubble's 25th anniversary in space on April 24, 2015, STScI released images of theWesterlund 2cluster, located about 20,000 light-years (6,100 pc) away in the constellation Carina, through its Hubble 25 website.The European Space Agency created a dedicated 25th anniversary page on its website.In April 2016, a special celebratory image of theBubble Nebulawas released for Hubble's 26th \"birthday\". HST uses gyroscopes to detect and measure any rotations so it can stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets. HST has six of these rate-sensing gyroscopes installed. Three gyroscopes are normally required for operation; observations are still possible with two or one, but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted, and observations requiring very accurate pointing are more difficult.In 2018, the plan was to drop into one-gyroscope mode if fewer than three working gyroscopes were operational. The gyroscopes are part of thePointing Control System, which uses five types of sensors (magnetic sensors, optical sensors, and the gyroscopes) and two types ofactuators(reaction wheelsandmagnetic torquers). After theColumbiadisasterin 2003, it was unclear whether another servicing mission would be possible, and gyroscope life became a concern again, so engineers developed new software for two-gyroscope and one-gyroscope modes to maximize the potential lifetime. The development was successful, and in 2005, it was decided to switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission. The switch to this mode was made in August 2005, leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use, two on backup, and two inoperable.One more gyroscope failed in 2007. By the time of the final repair mission in May 2009, during which all six gyroscopes were replaced (with two new pairs and one refurbished pair), only three were still working. Engineers determined that the gyroscope failures were caused by corrosion of electric wires powering the motor that was initiated by oxygen-pressurized air used to deliver the thick suspending fluid.The new gyroscope models were assembled using pressurized nitrogenand were expected to be much more reliable.In the 2009 servicing mission all six gyroscopes were replaced, and after almost ten years only three gyroscopes failed, and only after exceeding the average expected run time for the design. Of the six gyroscopes replaced in 2009, three were of the old design susceptible for flex-lead failure, and three were of the new design with a longer expected lifetime. The first of the old-style gyroscopes failed in March 2014, and the second in April 2018. On October 5, 2018, the last of the old-style gyroscopes failed, and one of the new-style gyroscopes was powered-up from standby state. However, that reserve gyroscope did not immediately perform within operational limits, and so the observatory was placed into \"safe\" mode while scientists attempted to fix the problem.NASA tweeted on October 22, 2018, that the \"rotation rates produced by the backup gyro have reduced and are now within a normal range. Additional tests [are] to be performed to ensure Hubble can return to science operations with this gyro.\" The solution that restored the backup new-style gyroscope to operational range was widely reported as \"turning it off and on again\".A \"running restart\" of the gyroscope was performed, but this had no effect, and the final resolution to the failure was more complex. The failure was attributed to an inconsistency in the fluid surrounding the float within the gyroscope, i.e. an air bubble. On October 18, 2018, the Hubble Operations Team directed the spacecraft into a series of maneuvers, moving it in opposite directions in order to mitigate the inconsistency. Only after the maneuvers, and a subsequent set of maneuvers on October 19, did the gyroscope truly operate within its normal range. Past servicing missions have exchanged old instruments for new ones, avoiding failure and making new types of science possible. Without servicing missions, all the instruments will eventually fail. In August 2004, the power system of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The electronics had originally been fully redundant, but the first set of electronics failed in May 2001.This power supply was fixed during Servicing Mission4 in May 2009. Similarly, the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) main camera primary electronics failed in June 2006, and the power supply for the backup electronics failed on January 27, 2007.Only the instrument's Solar Blind Channel (SBC) was operable using the side-1 electronics. A new power supply for the wide angle channel was added during SM 4, but quick tests revealed this did not help the high resolution channel.The Wide Field Channel (WFC) was returned to service by STS-125 in May 2009 but the High Resolution Channel (HRC) remains offline. On January 8, 2019, Hubble entered a partial safe mode following suspected hardware problems in its most advanced instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument. NASA later reported that the cause of the safe mode within the instrument was a detection of voltage levels out of a defined range. On January 15, 2019, NASA said the cause of the failure was a software problem. Engineering data within the telemetry circuits were not accurate. In addition, all other telemetry within those circuits also contained erroneous values indicating that this was a telemetry issue and not a power supply issue. After resetting the telemetry circuits and associated boards the instrument began functioning again. On January 17, 2019, the device was returned to normal operation and on the same day it completed its first science observations. On June 13, 2021, Hubble's payload computer halted due to a suspected issue with a memory module. An attempt to restart the computer on June 14 failed. Further attempts to switch to one of three other backup memory modules on board the spacecraft failed on June 18. On June 23 and 24, NASA engineers switched Hubble to a backup payload computer, but these operations have failed as well with the same error. On June 28, 2021, NASA announced that it was extending the investigation to other components.Scientific operations were suspended while NASA worked to diagnose and resolve the issue.After identifying a malfunctioning power control unit (PCU) supplying power to one of Hubble's computers, NASA was able to switch to a backup PCU and bring Hubble back to operational mode on July 16.On October 23, 2021, HST instruments reported missing synchronization messagesand went into safe mode.By December 8, 2021, NASA had restored full science operations and was developing updates to make instruments more resilient to missing synchronization messages. Hubble orbits the Earth in the extremely tenuous upperatmosphere, and over time its orbitdecaysdue todrag. If notreboosted, it will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere within some decades, with the exact date depending on how active the Sun is and its impact on the upper atmosphere. If Hubble were to descend in a completely uncontrolled re-entry, parts of the main mirror and its support structure would probably survive, leaving the potential for damage or even human fatalities.In 2013, deputy project manager James Jeletic projected that Hubble could survive into the 2020s.Based on solar activity and atmospheric drag, or lack thereof, a natural atmospheric reentry for Hubble will occur between 2028 and 2040.In June 2016, NASA extended the service contract for Hubble until June 2021.In November 2021, NASA extended the service contract for Hubble until June 2026. NASA's original plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was toretrieve it using a Space Shuttle. Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in theSmithsonian Institution. This is no longer possible since theSpace Shuttle fleet has been retired, and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and risk to the crew. Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry.Ultimately, in 2009, as part of Servicing Mission 4, the last servicing mission by the Space Shuttle, NASA installed the Soft Capture Mechanism (SCM), to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission. The SCM, together with the Relative Navigation System (RNS), mounted on the Shuttle to collect data to \"enable NASA to pursue numerous options for the safe de-orbit of Hubble\", constitute the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System (SCRS). As of 2017[update], theTrump Administrationwas considering a proposal by theSierra Nevada Corporationto use a crewed version of itsDream Chaserspacecraft to serviceHubblesome time in the 2020s as a continuation of its scientific capabilities and as insurance against any malfunctions in the James Webb Space Telescope.In 2020,John Grunsfeldsaid thatSpaceX Crew DragonorOrioncould perform another repair mission within ten years. While robotic technology is not yet sophisticated enough, he said, with another crewed visit \"We could keep Hubble going for another few decades\" with new gyros and instruments. Billionaireprivate astronautJared Isaacmanproposed to fund a servicing mission using SpaceX spacecraft. Though it might save NASA much money, SpaceX and NASA differed on the mission's risk.In September 2022, NASA and SpaceX signed a Space Act Agreement to investigate the possibility of launching a Crew Dragon mission to service and boost Hubble to a higher orbit, possibly extending its lifespan by another 20 years.This mission could have been the second of thePolaris Program, but by June 2024 NASA had rejected a private servicing mission because of potential damage to the observatory. There is no direct replacement to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes do not duplicate Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the further infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying the expense of a space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by usingadaptive optics(AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space. Plans for a Hubble successor materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which culminated in plans for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble.Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, it is designed to operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft.A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in theearly Universeapproximately 280million years older than stars HST now detects.The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and theCanadian Space Agencysince 1996,and was launched on December 25, 2021, on anAriane 5rocket.Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light. A complementary telescope, looking at even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency'sHerschel Space Observatory, launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel was not designed to be serviced after launch, and had a mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in thefar infraredandsubmillimeter. It needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013. Further concepts for advanced 21st-century space telescopes include theLarge Ultraviolet Optical Infrared Surveyor(LUVOIR),a conceptualized 8 to 16.8 meters (310 to 660 inches) optical space telescope that if realized could be a more direct successor to HST, with the ability to observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the Spitzer Space Telescope. The final planning report, prepared for the 2020Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey, suggested a launch date of 2039.The Decadal Survey eventually recommended that ideas for LUVOIR be combined with theHabitable Exoplanet Observerproposal to devise a new, 6-meter flagship telescope that could launch in the 2040s. Existing ground-based telescopes, and various proposedExtremely Large Telescopes, can exceed the HST in terms of sheer light-gathering power and diffraction limit due to larger mirrors, but other factors affect telescopes. In some cases, they may be able to match or exceed Hubble in resolution by using adaptive optics (AO). However, AO on large ground-based reflectors will not make Hubble and other space telescopes obsolete. Most AO systems sharpen the view over a very narrow field:Lucky Cam, for example, produces crisp images just 10 to 20 arcseconds wide, whereas Hubble's cameras produce crisp images across a 150-arcsecond (2½ arcminutes) field. Furthermore, space telescopes can study the universe across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, most of which is blocked by Earth's atmosphere. Finally, the background sky is darker in space than on the ground, because air absorbs solar energy during the day and then releases it at night, producing a faint but discernibleairglowthat washes out low-contrast astronomical objects.\n",

            "AMars roveris a remote-controlledmotor vehicledesigned to travel on the surface ofMars.Rovershave several advantages over stationarylanders: they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remoteroboticvehicle control. They serve a different purpose than orbital spacecraft likeMars Reconnaissance Orbiter. A more recent development is theMars helicopter. As of May 2021[update], there have been six successful robotically operated Mars rovers; the first five, managed by the AmericanNASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, were (by date of Mars landing):Sojourner(1997),Spirit(2004–2010),Opportunity(2004–2018),Curiosity(2012–present), andPerseverance(2021–present). The sixth, managed by theChina National Space Administration, isZhurong(2021–2022). On January 24, 2016,NASAreported thatongoing studieson Mars byOpportunityandCuriositywould be searching for evidence of ancient life, including abiospherebased onautotrophic,chemotrophicorchemolithoautotrophicmicroorganisms, as well as ancient water, includingfluvio-lacustrine environments(plainsrelated to ancientriversorlakes) that may have beenhabitable.The search for evidence ofhabitability,taphonomy(related tofossils), andorganic carbonon Mars has become a primary NASA objective. The Soviet probes,Mars 2andMars 3, were physically tethered probes;Sojournerwas dependent on theMars Pathfinderbase station for communication with Earth;Opportunity,SpiritandCuriositywere on their own. As of April 27, 2025,Curiosityis still active, whileSpirit,Opportunity, andSojournercompleted their missions before losing contact. On February 18, 2021,Perseverance, the newest American Mars rover, successfully landed.  On May 14, 2021, China'sZhurongbecame the first non-American rover to successfully operate on Mars. Examples of instruments onboard landed rovers include: Circa the 2010s, NASA had established certain goals for the rover program. NASA distinguishes between \"mission\" objectives and \"science\" objectives. Mission objectives are related to progress inspace technologyand development processes. Science objectives are met by the instruments during their mission in space. The science instruments are chosen and designed based on the science objectives and goals. The primary goal of theSpiritandOpportunityrovers was to investigate \"the history of water on Mars\". The four science goals of NASA's long-termMars Exploration Programare:\n",

            "TheInternational Space Station(ISS) is a largespace stationthat wasassembledand is maintained inlow Earth orbitby a collaboration of five space agencies and their contractors:NASA(United States),Roscosmos(Russia),ESA(Europe),JAXA(Japan), andCSA(Canada). As the largest space station ever constructed, it primarily serves as a platform for conducting scientific experiments inmicrogravityand studying thespace environment. The station is divided into two main sections: theRussian Orbital Segment(ROS), developed by Roscosmos, and theUS Orbital Segment(USOS), built by NASA, ESA, JAXA, and CSA. A striking feature of the ISS is theIntegrated Truss Structure, which connect the station's vast system ofsolar panelsandradiatorsto its pressurized modules. These modules support diverse functions, including scientific research, crew habitation, storage, spacecraft control, and airlock operations. The ISS has eightdocking and berthing portsfor visiting spacecraft. The station orbits the Earth at an average altitude of 400 kilometres (250 miles)and circles the Earth in roughly 93 minutes, completing 15.5 orbits per day. TheISS programmecombines two previously planned crewed Earth-orbiting stations: the United States'Space StationFreedomand the Soviet Union'sMir-2. Thefirst ISS modulewas launched in 1998, with major components delivered byProtonandSoyuzrockets and theSpace Shuttle. Long-term occupancy began on 2 November 2000, with the arrival of theExpedition 1crew. Since then, the ISS has remained continuously inhabited for 24 years and 359 days, the longest continuous human presence in space. As of August 2025[update], 290 individuals from 26 countries had visited the station. Future plans for the ISS include the addition of at least one module,Axiom Space'sPayload Power Thermal Module. The station is expected to remain operational until the end of 2030, after which it will be de-orbited using theUS Deorbit Vehicle. As thespace racedrew to a close in the early 1970s, the US andUSSRbegan to contemplate a variety of potential collaborations in outer space. This culminated in the 1975Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first docking of spacecraft from two different spacefaring nations. The ASTP was considered a success, and further joint missions were also contemplated. One such concept was International Skylab, which proposed launching the backupSkylab Bspace station for a mission that would see multiple visits by bothApolloandSoyuzcrew vehicles.More ambitious was the Skylab-Salyut Space Laboratory, which proposed docking the Skylab B to a SovietSalyutspace station. Falling budgets and risingCold Wartensions in the late 1970s saw these concepts fall by the wayside, along with another plan to have theSpace Shuttledock with a Salyut space station. In the early 1980s,NASAplanned to launch a modular space station calledFreedomas a counterpart to the Salyut andMirspace stations. In 1984 the ESA was invited to participate in Space StationFreedom, and the ESA approved the Columbus laboratory by 1987.TheJapanese Experiment Module(JEM), orKibō, was announced in 1985, as part of theFreedomspace station in response to a NASA request in 1982. In early 1985, science ministers from theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) countries approved theColumbusprogramme, the most ambitious effort in space undertaken by that organization at the time. The plan spearheaded by Germany and Italy included a module which would be attached toFreedom, and with the capability to evolve into a full-fledged European orbital outpost before the end of the century. Increasing costs threw these plans into doubt in the early 1990s. Congress was unwilling to provide enough money to build and operateFreedom, and demanded NASA increase international participation to defray the rising costs or they would cancel the entire project outright. Simultaneously, the USSR was conducting planning for theMir-2space station, and had begun constructing modules for the new station by the mid-1980s. However thecollapse of the Soviet Unionrequired these plans to be greatly downscaled, and soon Mir-2 was in danger of never being launched at all.With both space station projects in jeopardy, American and Russian officials met and proposed they be combined. The ISS was originally intended to be a laboratory, observatory, and factory while providing transportation, maintenance, and alow Earth orbitstaging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. However, not all of the uses envisioned in the initialmemorandum of understandingbetweenNASAandRoscosmoshave been realised.In the2010 United States National Space Policy, the ISS was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic,and educational purposes. The ISS provides a platform to conduct scientific research, with power, data, cooling, and crew available to support experiments. Small uncrewed spacecraft can also provide platforms for experiments, especially those involving zero gravity and exposure to space, but space stations offer a long-term environment where studies can be performed potentially for decades, combined with ready access by human researchers. The ISS simplifies individual experiments by allowing groups of experiments to share the same launches and crew time. Research is conducted in a wide variety of fields, includingastrobiology,astronomy,physical sciences,materials science,space weather,meteorology, andhuman researchincludingspace medicineand thelife sciences.Scientists on Earth have timely access to the data and can suggest experimental modifications to the crew. If follow-on experiments are necessary, the routinely scheduled launches of resupply craft allows new hardware to be launched with relative ease.Crews flyexpeditionsof several months' duration, providing approximately 160 man-hours per week of labour with a crew of six. However, a considerable amount of crew time is taken up by station maintenance. Perhaps the most notable ISS experiment is theAlpha Magnetic Spectrometer(AMS), which is intended to detect dark matter and answer other fundamental questions about our universe. According to NASA, the AMS is as important as theHubble Space Telescope. Currently docked on station, it could not have been easily accommodated on a free flying satellite platform because of its power and bandwidth needs.On 3 April 2013, scientists reported that hints ofdark mattermay have been detected by the AMS.According to the scientists, \"The first results from the space-borne Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer confirm an unexplained excess of high-energy positrons in Earth-bound cosmic rays\". The space environment is hostile to life. Unprotected presence in space is characterised by an intense radiation field (consisting primarily of protons and other subatomic charged particles from thesolar wind, in addition tocosmic rays), high vacuum, extreme temperatures, and microgravity.Some simple forms of life calledextremophiles,as well as small invertebrates calledtardigradescan survive in this environment in an extremely dry state throughdesiccation. Medical research improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body, includingmuscle atrophy,bone loss, and fluid shift. These data will be used to determine whether high durationhuman spaceflightandspace colonisationare feasible. In 2006, data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggested that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise, such as the six-month interval required totravel to Mars. Medical studies are conducted aboard the ISS on behalf of theNational Space Biomedical Research Institute(NSBRI). Prominent among these is theAdvanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravitystudy in which astronauts perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts. The study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space. Usually, there is no physician on board the ISS and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge. It is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult. In August 2020, scientists reported thatbacteriafrom Earth, particularlyDeinococcus radioduransbacteria, which is highly resistant toenvironmental hazards, were found to survive for three years inouter space, based on studies conducted on the International Space Station. These findings supported the notion ofpanspermia, the hypothesis thatlifeexists throughout theUniverse, distributed in various ways, includingspace dust,meteoroids,asteroids,comets,planetoidsorcontaminatedspacecraft. Remote sensingof the Earth, astronomy, and deep space research on the ISS have significantly increased during the 2010s after the completion of theUS Orbital Segmentin 2011. Throughout the more than 20 years of the ISS program, researchers aboard the ISS and on the ground have examinedaerosols,ozone,lightning, andoxidesin Earth's atmosphere, as well as theSun, cosmic rays,cosmic dust,antimatter, and dark matter in the universe. Examples of Earth-viewing remote sensing experiments that have flown on the ISS are theOrbiting Carbon Observatory 3,ISS-RapidScat,ECOSTRESS, theGlobal Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation, and theCloud Aerosol Transport System. ISS-based astronomy telescopes and experiments includeSOLAR, theNeutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, theCalorimetric Electron Telescope, theMonitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI), and theAlpha Magnetic Spectrometer. Researchers are investigating the effect of the station's near-weightless environment on the evolution, development, growth and internal processes of plants and animals. In response to some of the data, NASA wants to investigatemicrogravity's effects on the growth of three-dimensional, human-like tissues and the unusualprotein crystalsthat can be formed in space. Investigating the physics of fluids in microgravity will provide better models of the behaviour of fluids. Because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity, physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on Earth. Examining reactions that are slowed by low gravity and low temperatures will improve our understanding ofsuperconductivity. The study ofmaterials scienceis an important ISS research activity, with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on Earth.Other areas of interest include the effect of low gravity on combustion, through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants. These findings may improve knowledge about energy production and lead to economic and environmental benefits. The ISS provides a location in the relative safety of low Earth orbit to test spacecraft systems that will be required for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. This provides experience in operations, maintenance, and repair and replacement activities on-orbit. This will help develop essential skills in operating spacecraft farther from Earth, reduce mission risks, and advance the capabilities of interplanetary spacecraft.Referring to theMARS-500experiment, a crew isolation experiment conducted on Earth, ESA states, \"Whereas the ISS is essential for answering questions concerning the possible impact of weightlessness, radiation and other space-specific factors, aspects such as the effect of long-term isolation and confinement can be more appropriately addressed via ground-based simulations\".Sergey Krasnov, the head of human space flight programmes for Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, in 2011 suggested a \"shorter version\" of MARS-500 may be carried out on the ISS. In 2009, noting the value of the partnership framework itself, Sergey Krasnov wrote, \"When compared with partners acting separately, partners developing complementary abilities and resources could give us much more assurance of the success and safety of space exploration. The ISS is helping further advance near-Earth space exploration and realisation of prospective programmes of research and exploration of the Solar system, including the Moon and Mars.\"A crewed mission to Marsmay be a multinational effort involving space agencies and countries outside the current ISS partnership. In 2010, ESA Director-General Jean-Jacques Dordain stated his agency was ready to propose to the other four partners that China, India, and South Korea be invited to join the ISS partnership.NASA chiefCharles Boldenstated in February 2011, \"Any mission to Mars is likely to be a global effort.\"Currently,US federal legislationprevents NASA co-operation with China on space projects without approval by theFBIand Congress. The ISS crew provides opportunities for students on Earth by running student-developed experiments, making educational demonstrations, allowing for student participation in classroom versions of ISS experiments, and directly engaging students using radio, and email.ESA offers a wide range of free teaching materials that can be downloaded for use in classrooms.In one lesson, students can navigate a3D modelof the interior and exterior of the ISS, and face spontaneous challenges to solve in real time. TheJapanese Aerospace Exploration Agency(JAXA) aims to inspire children to \"pursue craftsmanship\" and to heighten their \"awareness of the importance of life and their responsibilities in society\".Through a series of education guides, students develop a deeper understanding of the past and near-term future of crewed space flight, as well as that of Earth and life.In the JAXA \"Seeds in Space\" experiments, the mutation effects of spaceflight on plant seeds aboard the ISS are explored by growing sunflower seeds that have flown on the ISS for about nine months. In the first phase ofKibōutilisation from 2008 to mid-2010, researchers from more than a dozen Japanese universities conducted experiments in diverse fields. Cultural activities are another major objective of the ISS programme. Tetsuo Tanaka, the director of JAXA's Space Environment and Utilization Center, has said: \"There is something about space that touches even people who are not interested in science.\" Amateur Radio on the ISS(ARISS) is a volunteer programme that encourages students worldwide to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, throughamateur radiocommunications opportunities with the ISS crew. ARISS is an international working group, consisting of delegations from nine countries including several in Europe, as well as Japan, Russia, Canada, and the United States. In areas where radio equipment cannot be used,speakerphonesconnect students to ground stations which then connect the calls to the space station. First Orbitis a 2011 feature-length documentary film aboutVostok 1, the first crewed space flight around the Earth. By matching the orbit of the ISS to that of Vostok 1 as closely as possible, in terms of ground path and time of day, documentary filmmakerChristopher Rileyand ESA astronautPaolo Nespoliwere able to film the view thatYuri Gagarinsaw on his pioneering orbital space flight. This new footage was cut together with the original Vostok 1 mission audio recordings sourced from the Russian State Archive. Nespoli is credited as thedirector of photographyfor this documentary film, as he recorded the majority of the footage himself duringExpedition 26/27.The film was streamed in a global YouTube premiere in 2011 under a free licence through the websitefirstorbit.org. In May 2013, commanderChris Hadfieldshot a music video ofDavid Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" on board the station, which was released on YouTube.It was the first music video filmed in space. In November 2017, while participating inExpedition 52/53on the ISS,Paolo Nespolimade two recordings of his spoken voice (one in English and the other in his native Italian), for use onWikipediaarticles. These were the first content made in space specifically for Wikipedia. In November 2021, avirtual realityexhibit called The Infinite featuring life aboard the ISS was announced. Involving five space programs and fifteen countries,the International Space Station is the most politically and legally complex space exploration programme in history.The 1998 Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement sets forth the primary framework for international cooperation among the parties. A series of subsequent agreements govern other aspects of the station, ranging from jurisdictional issues to a code of conduct among visiting astronauts. Brazil was also invited to participate in the programme, the only developing country to receive such an invitation. Under the agreement framework, Brazil was to provide six pieces of hardware, and in exchange, would receive ISS utilization rights. However, Brazil was unable to deliver any of the elements due to a lack of funding and political priority within the country. Brazil officially dropped out of the ISS programme in 2007. Following the2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, continued cooperation between Russia and other countries on the International Space Station has been put into question. Roscosmos Director GeneralDmitry Rogozininsinuated that Russian withdrawal could cause the International Space Station to de-orbit due to lack of reboost capabilities, writing in a series of tweets, \"If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from an unguided de-orbit to impact on the territory of the US or Europe? There's also the chance of impact of the 500-ton construction in India or China. Do you want to threaten them with such a prospect? The ISS doesn't fly over Russia, so all the risk is yours. Are you ready for it?\"(This latter claim is untrue: the ISS flies over all parts of the Earth between 51.6 degrees latitude north and south, approximately the latitude ofSaratov.) Rogozin later tweeted that normal relations between ISS partners could only be restored once sanctions have been lifted, and indicated that Roscosmos would submit proposals to the Russian government on ending cooperation.NASA stated that, if necessary, US corporationNorthrop Grummanhas offered a reboost capability that would keep the ISS in orbit. On 26 July 2022,Yury Borisov, Rogozin's successor as head of Roscosmos, submitted to Russian President Putin plans for withdrawal from the programme after 2024.However, Robyn Gatens, the NASA official in charge of the space station, responded that NASA had not received any formal notices from Roscosmos concerning withdrawal plans. The International Space Station is a product of global collaboration, with its components manufactured across the world. The modules of theRussian Orbital Segment, includingZaryaandZvezda, were produced at theKhrunichev State Research and Production Space Centerin Moscow.Zvezdawas initially manufactured in 1985 as a component for theMir-2space station, which was never launched. Much of theUS Orbital Segment, including theDestinyandUnitymodules, theIntegrated Truss Structure, andsolar arrays, were built at NASA'sMarshall Space Flight CenterinHuntsville, AlabamaandMichoud Assembly FacilityinNew Orleans.These components underwent final assembly and processing for launch at theOperations and Checkout Buildingand theSpace Station Processing Facility(SSPF) at theKennedy Space Centerin Florida. The US Orbital Segment also hosts theColumbusmodule contributed by theEuropean Space Agencyand built in Germany, theKibōmodule contributed byJapanand built at theTsukuba Space Centerand theInstitute of Space and Astronautical Science, along with theCanadarm2andDextre, a joint Canadian-U.S. endeavor. All of these components were shipped to the SSPF for launch processing. The assembly of the International Space Station, a major endeavour inspace architecture, began in November 1998. Modules in the Russian segment launched and docked autonomously, with the exception ofRassvet. Other modules and components were delivered by theSpace Shuttle, which then had to be installed by astronauts either remotely using robotic arms or during spacewalks, more formally known asextra-vehicular activities(EVAs). By 5 June 2011 astronauts had made over 159 EVAs to add components to the station, totaling more than 1,000 hours in space. The beginning of the core of the ISS's tenure in orbit was the launch of the Russian-builtZaryamodule atop aProton rocketon 20 November 1998.Zaryaprovided propulsion,attitude control, communications, and electrical power. Two weeks later on 4 December 1998, the American-madeUnitywas ferried aboardSpace ShuttleEndeavouronSTS-88and joined withZarya.Unityprovided the connection between the Russian and US segments of the station and would provide ports to connect future modules and visiting spacecraft. While the connection of two modules built on different continents, by nations that were once bitter rivals was a significant milestone, these two initial modules lacked life-support systems and the ISS remained unmanned for the next two years. At the time, the Russian stationMirwas still inhabited. The turning point arrived in July 2000 with the launch of theZvezdamodule. Equipped with living quarters and life-support systems,Zvezdaenabled continuous human presence aboard the station. The first crew,Expedition 1, arrived that November aboardSoyuz TM-31. The ISS grew steadily over the following years, with modules delivered by both Russian rockets and the Space Shuttle. Expedition 1 arrived midway between the Space Shuttle flights of missionsSTS-92andSTS-97. These two flights each added segments of the station'sIntegrated Truss Structure, which provided the station withKu bandcommunications, additional attitude control needed for the additional mass of the USOS, and additional solar arrays.Over the next two years, the station continued to expand. ASoyuz-Urocket delivered thePirsdocking compartment. The Space ShuttlesDiscovery,Atlantis, andEndeavourdelivered the AmericanDestinylaboratory andQuestairlock, in addition to the station's main robot arm, theCanadarm2, and several more segments of the Integrated Truss Structure. Tragedy struck in 2003 with theloss of the Space ShuttleColumbia, which grounded the rest of the Shuttle fleet, halting construction of the ISS. Assembly resumed in 2006 with the arrival ofSTS-115withAtlantis, which delivered the station's second set of solar arrays. Several more truss segments and a third set of arrays were delivered onSTS-116,STS-117, andSTS-118. As a result of the major expansion of the station's power-generating capabilities, more modules could be accommodated, and the USHarmonymodule andColumbusEuropean laboratory were added. These were soon followed by the first two components of the JapaneseKibōlaboratory. In March 2009,STS-119completed the Integrated Truss Structure with the installation of the fourth and final set of solar arrays. The final section ofKibōwas delivered in July 2009 onSTS-127, followed by the RussianPoiskmodule. The USTranquilitymodule was delivered in February 2010 duringSTS-130, alongside theCupola, followed by the penultimate Russian module,Rassvet, in May 2010.Rassvetwas delivered by Space ShuttleAtlantisonSTS-132in exchange for the Russian Proton delivery of the US-fundedZaryamodule in 1998.The last pressurised module of the USOS,Leonardo, was brought to the station in February 2011 on the final flight ofDiscovery,STS-133. Russia's new primary research moduleNaukadocked in July 2021,along with the European Robotic Arm which can relocate itself to different parts of the Russian modules of the station.Russia's latest addition, thePrichalmodule, docked in November 2021. As of June 2025, nasa.gov states that there are 43 different modules and elements installed on the ISS. The ISS functions as a modular space station, enabling the addition or removal of modules from its structure for increased adaptability. Below is a diagram of major station components. TheUnitynode joins directly to theDestinylaboratory; for clarity, they are shown apart. Similar cases are also seen in other parts of the structure. Key to box background colors: Zarya(Russian:Заря,lit.'Sunrise'[e]), also known as theFunctional Cargo Block(Russian:Функционально-грузовой блок), was the inaugural component of the ISS. Launched in 1998, it initially served as the ISS's power source, storage, propulsion, and guidance system. As the station has grown,Zarya's role has transitioned primarily to storage, both internally and in its external fuel tanks. A descendant of theTKS spacecraftused in theSalyutprogramme,Zaryawas built in Russia but is owned by the United States. Its name symbolizes the beginning of a new era of international space cooperation. Unity, also known asNode 1, is the inaugural U.S.-built component of the ISS.Serving as the connection between the Russian and U.S. segments, this cylindrical module features sixCommon Berthing Mechanismlocations (forward,aft,port,starboard,zenith, andnadir) for attaching additional modules. Measuring 4.57 metres (15.0 ft) in diameter and 5.47 metres (17.9 ft) in length,Unitywas constructed of steel byBoeingfor NASA at theMarshall Space Flight CenterinHuntsville, Alabama. It was the first of three connecting nodes –Unity,Harmony, andTranquility– that forms the structural backbone of the U.S. segment of the ISS. Zvezda(Russian:Звезда,lit.'star') launched in July 2000, is the core of theRussian Orbital Segmentof the ISS. Initially providing essential living quarters andlife-support systems, it enabled the first continuous human presence aboard the station. While additional modules have expanded the ISS's capabilities, Zvezda remains the command and control center for the Russian segment and it is where crews gather during emergencies. A descendant of the Salyut programme's DOS spacecraft, Zvezda was built byRKK Energiaand launched atop aProton rocket. TheDestinylaboratory is the primary research facility for U.S. experiments on the ISS. NASA's first permanent orbital research station since Skylab, the module was built by Boeing and launched aboardSpace ShuttleAtlantisduringSTS-98. Attached toUnityover a period of five days in February 2001,Destinyhas been a hub for scientific research ever since. WithinDestiny, astronauts conduct experiments in fields such as medicine, engineering, biotechnology, physics, materials science, and Earth science. Researchers worldwide benefit from these studies. The module also houses life-support systems, including theOxygen Generating System. TheQuest Joint Airlockenablesextravehicular activities(EVAs) using either the U.S.Extravehicular Mobility Unit(EMU) or the RussianOrlan space suit. Before its installation, conducting EVAs from the ISS was challenging due to a variety of system and design differences. Only the Orlan suit could be used from the Transfer Chamber on theZvezdamodule (which was not a purpose-built airlock) and the EMU could only be used from the airlock on a visiting Space Shuttle, which could not accommodate the Orlan. Launched aboardSpace ShuttleAtlantisduringSTS-104in July 2001 and attached to the Unity module, Quest is a 6.1-metre-long (20 ft), 4.0-metre-wide (13 ft) structure built by Boeing.It houses the crew airlock for astronaut egress, an equipment airlock for suit storage, and has facilities to accommodate astronauts during their overnight pre-breathe procedures to prevent decompression sickness. The crew airlock, derived from the Space Shuttle, features essential equipment like lighting, handrails, and an Umbilical Interface Assembly (UIA) that provides life-support and communication systems for up to two spacesuits simultaneously. These can be either two EMUs, two Orlan suits, or one of each design. Poisk(Russian:По́иск,lit.'Search'), also known as theMini-Research Module 2(Russian:Малый исследовательский модуль 2), serves as both a secondary airlock on the Russian segment of the ISS and supports docking for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, facilitates propellant transfers from the latter.Launched on 10 November 2009 attached to a modifiedProgress spacecraft, calledProgress M-MIM2. Poiskprovides facilities to maintain Orlan spacesuits and is equipped with two inward-opening hatches, a design change fromMir, which encountered a dangerous situation caused by an outward-opening hatch that opened too quickly because of a small amount of air pressure remaining in the airlock.Since the departure ofPirsin 2021, it's become the sole airlock on the Russian segment. Harmony, orNode 2, is the central connecting hub of the US segment of the ISS, linking the U.S., European, and Japanese laboratory modules. It's also been called the \"utility hub\" of the ISS as it provides essential power, data, and life-support systems. The module also houses sleeping quarters for four crew members. Launched on 23 October 2007 aboardSpace ShuttleDiscoveryonSTS-120,Harmony was initially attached to the Unitybefore being relocated to its permanent position at the front of the Destiny laboratory on 14 November 2007.This expansion added significant living space to the ISS, marking a key milestone in the construction of the U.S. segment. Tranquility, also known asNode 3, is a module of the ISS. It contains environmental control systems,life-support systems, a toilet, exercise equipment, and an observationcupola. The European Space Agency and theItalian Space AgencyhadTranquilitymanufactured byThales Alenia Space. A ceremony on 20 November 2009 transferred ownership of the module to NASA.On 8 February 2010, NASA launched the module on the Space Shuttle'sSTS-130mission. Columbusis a science laboratory that is part of the ISS and is the largest single contribution to the station made by the European Space Agency. Like theHarmonyandTranquilitymodules, theColumbuslaboratory was constructed inTurin, Italy byThales Alenia Space. The functional equipment and software of the lab was designed byEADSinBremen, Germany. It was also integrated in Bremen before being flown to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in anAirbus Belugajet. It was launched aboard Space ShuttleAtlantison 7 February 2008, on flightSTS-122. It is designed for ten years of operation. The module is controlled by theColumbus Control Centre, located at theGerman Space Operations Center, part of theGerman Aerospace CenterinOberpfaffenhofennearMunich, Germany. The European Space Agency has spent€1.4 billion (aboutUS$1.6 billion) on buildingColumbus, including the experiments it carries and the ground control infrastructure necessary to operate them. Kibō(Japanese:きぼう;lit.'hope'), also known as theJapanese Experiment Module, is Japan's research facility on the ISS. It is the largest single module on the ISS, consisting of a pressurized lab, an exposed facility for conducting experiments in the space environment, two storage compartments, and a robotic arm. Attached to theHarmonymodule,Kibōwas assembled in space over three Space Shuttle missions:STS-123,STS-124andSTS-127. TheCupolais anESA-built observatory module of the ISS. Its name derives from the Italian wordcupola, which means \"dome\". Its seven windows are used to conduct experiments, dockings and observations of Earth. It was launched aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-130 on 8 February 2010 and attached to theTranquility(Node 3) module. With theCupolaattached, ISS assembly reached 85 per cent completion. TheCupola'scentral window has a diameter of 80 cm (31 in). Rassvet(Russian:Рассвет,lit.'first light'), also known as theMini-Research Module 1(Russian:Малый исследовательский модуль 1) and formerly known as theDocking Cargo Moduleis primarily used for cargo storage and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft on the Russian segment of the ISS.Rassvetreplaced the cancelled Docking and Storage Module and used a design largely based on theMir Docking Modulebuilt in 1995. Rassvet was delivered in on 14 May 2010Space ShuttleAtlantisonSTS-132in exchange for the Russian Proton delivery of the US-fundedZaryamodule in 1998.Rassvetwas attached toZaryashortly thereafter. TheLeonardoPermanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) was flown into space aboard the Space ShuttleDiscoveryonSTS-133on 24 February 2011 and installed on 1 March.Leonardois primarily used for storage of spares, supplies and waste on the ISS, which was until then stored in many different places within the space station. It is also the personal hygiene area for the astronauts who live in theUS Orbital Segment. TheLeonardoPMM was aMulti-Purpose Logistics Module(MPLM) before 2011, but was modified into its current configuration. It was formerly one of two MPLM used for bringing cargo to and from the ISS with the Space Shuttle. The module was named for Italian polymathLeonardo da Vinci. TheBigelow Expandable Activity Module(BEAM) is an experimentalexpandablespace station moduledeveloped byBigelow Aerospace, under contract to NASA, for testing as a temporary module on the International Space Station (ISS) from 2016 to at least 2020. It arrived at the ISS on 10 April 2016,was berthed to the station on 16 April at Tranquility Node 3, and was expanded and pressurized on 28 May 2016. In December 2021, Bigelow Aerospace conveyed ownership of the module to NASA, as a result of Bigelow's cessation of activity. TheInternational Docking Adapter(IDA) is aspacecraft docking system adapterdeveloped to convertAPAS-95to theNASA Docking System(NDS). An IDA is placed on each of the ISS's two openPressurized Mating Adapters(PMAs), both of which are connected to theHarmonymodule. Two International Docking Adapters are currently installed aboard the Station. Originally,IDA-1was planned to be installed on PMA-2, located atHarmony's forward port, andIDA-2would be installed on PMA-3 atHarmony's zenith. After IDA 1 was destroyed ina launch incident,IDA-2was installed on PMA-2 on 19 August 2016,whileIDA-3was later installed on PMA-3 on 21 August 2019. The NanoRacks Bishop Airlock Module is acommerciallyfundedairlockmodule launched to the ISS onSpaceX CRS-21on 6 December 2020.The module was built byNanoRacks,Thales Alenia Space, and Boeing.It will be used to deployCubeSats,small satellites, and other external payloads for NASA,CASIS, and other commercial and governmental customers. Nauka(Russian:Наука,lit.'Science'), also known as theMultipurpose Laboratory Module, Upgrade(Russian:Многоцелевой лабораторный модуль, усоверше́нствованный), is a Roscosmos-funded component of the ISS that was launched on 21 July 2021, 14:58 UTC. In the original ISS plans,Naukawas to use the location of theDocking and Stowage Module(DSM), but the DSM was later replaced by theRassvetmodule and moved toZarya's nadir port.Naukawas successfully docked toZvezda's nadir port on 29 July 2021, 13:29 UTC, replacing thePirsmodule. It had a temporary docking adapter on its nadir port for crewed and uncrewed missions until Prichal arrival, where just before its arrival it was removed by a departing Progress spacecraft. Prichal(Russian:Причал,lit.'pier') is a 4-tonne (8,800 lb) spherical module that serves as a docking hub for the Russian segment of the ISS. Launched in November 2021, Prichal provides additional docking ports for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, as well as potential future modules.Prichalfeatures six docking ports: forward, aft, port, starboard, zenith, and nadir. One of these ports, equipped with an active hybrid docking system, enabled it to dock with the Nauka module. The remaining five ports are passive hybrids, allowing for docking of Soyuz, Progress, and heavier modules, as well as future spacecraft with modified docking systems. As of 2024, the forward, aft, port and starboard docking ports remain covered.Prichalwas initially intended to be an element of the now canceledOrbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex. The ISS has a large number of external components that do not require pressurisation. The largest of these is theIntegrated Truss Structure(ITS), to which the station's mainsolar arraysandthermal radiatorsare mounted.The ITS consists of ten separate segments forming a structure 108.5 metres (356 ft) long. The station was intended to have several smaller external components, such as six robotic arms, threeExternal Stowage Platforms(ESPs) and fourExPRESS Logistics Carriers(ELCs).While these platforms allow experiments (includingMISSE, the STP-H3 and theRobotic Refueling Mission) to be deployed and conducted in the vacuum of space by providing electricity and processing experimental data locally, their primary function is to store spareOrbital Replacement Units(ORUs). ORUs are parts that can be replaced when they fail or pass their design life, including pumps, storage tanks, antennas, and battery units. Such units are replaced either by astronauts during EVA or by robotic arms.Several shuttle missions were dedicated to the delivery of ORUs, includingSTS-129,STS-133and STS-134.As of January 2011[update], only one other mode of transportation of ORUs had been used – the Japanese cargo vesselHTV-2– which delivered an FHRC and CTC-2 via its Exposed Pallet (EP).[needs update] There are also smaller exposure facilities mounted directly to laboratory modules; theKibōExposed Facilityserves as an external \"porch\" for theKibōcomplex,and a facility on the EuropeanColumbuslaboratory provides power and data connections for experiments such as theEuropean Technology Exposure Facilityand theAtomic Clock Ensemble in Space.Aremote sensinginstrument,SAGE III-ISS, was delivered to the station in February 2017 aboardCRS-10,and theNICERexperiment was delivered aboardCRS-11in June 2017.The largest scientific payload externally mounted to the ISS is theAlpha Magnetic Spectrometer(AMS), a particle physics experiment launched on STS-134 in May 2011, and mounted externally on the ITS. The AMS measures cosmic rays to look for evidence of dark matter and antimatter. The commercialBartolomeoExternal Payload Hosting Platform, manufactured by Airbus, was launched on 6 March 2020 aboardCRS-20and attached to the EuropeanColumbusmodule. It will provide an additional 12 external payload slots, supplementing the eight on theExPRESS Logistics Carriers, ten onKibō, and four onColumbus. The system is designed to be robotically serviced and will require no astronaut intervention. It is named after Christopher Columbus's younger brother. In May 2010, equipment forNaukawas launched on STS-132 (as part of an agreement with NASA) and delivered by Space ShuttleAtlantis. Weighing 1.4 metric tons, the equipment was attached to the outside ofRassvet(MRM-1). It included a spare elbow joint for theEuropean Robotic Arm(ERA) (which was launched withNauka) and an ERA-portable workpost used during EVAs, as well as RTOd add-on heat radiator and internal hardware alongside the pressurized experiment airlock. The RTOd radiator adds additional cooling capability toNauka, which enables the module to host more scientific experiments. The ERA was used to remove the RTOd radiator fromRassvetand transferred over toNaukaduring VKD-56 spacewalk. Later it was activated and fully deployed on VKD-58 spacewalk.This process took several months. A portable work platform was also transferred over in August 2023 during VKD-60 spacewalk, which can attach to the end of the ERA to allow cosmonauts to \"ride\" on the end of the arm during spacewalks.However, even after several months of outfitting EVAs and RTOd heat radiator installation, six months later, the RTOd radiator malfunctioned before active use of Nauka (the purpose of RTOd installation is to radiate heat from Nauka experiments). The malfunction, a leak, rendered the RTOd radiator unusable for Nauka. This is the third ISS radiator leak afterSoyuz MS-22andProgress MS-21radiator leaks. If a spare RTOd is not available, Nauka experiments will have to rely on Nauka's main launch radiator and the module could never be used to its full capacity. Another MLM outfitting is a 4 segment external payload interface called means of attachment of large payloads (Sredstva Krepleniya Krupnogabaritnykh Obyektov, SKKO).Delivered in two parts to Nauka byProgress MS-18(LCCS part) andProgress MS-21(SCCCS part) as part of the module activation outfitting process.It was taken outside and installed on the ERA aft facing base point on Nauka during the VKD-55 spacewalk. The Integrated Truss Structure (ITS) serves as a base for the station's primary remote manipulator system, theMobile Servicing System(MSS), which is composed of three main components: Agrapple fixturewas added toZaryaon STS-134 to enable Canadarm2 to inchworm itself onto the ROS.Also installed during STS-134 was the 15 m (50 ft)Orbiter Boom Sensor System(OBSS), which had been used to inspect heat shield tiles on Space Shuttle missions and which can be used on the station to increase the reach of the MSS.Staff on Earth or the ISS can operate the MSS components using remote control, performing work outside the station without the need for space walks. Japan'sRemote Manipulator System, which services theKibōExposed Facility,was launched onSTS-124and is attached to theKibōPressurised Module.The arm is similar to the Space Shuttle arm as it is permanently attached at one end and has a latching end effector for standard grapple fixtures at the other. TheEuropean Robotic Arm, which will service the ROS, was launched alongside theNaukamodule.The ROS does not require spacecraft or modules to be manipulated, as all spacecraft and modules dock automatically and may be discarded the same way. Crew use the twoStrela(Russian:Стрела́,lit.'Arrow') cargo cranes during EVAs for moving crew and equipment around the ROS. Each Strela crane has a mass of 45 kg (99 lb). Pirs (Russian: Пирс, lit. 'Pier') was launched on 14 September 2001, as ISS Assembly Mission 4R, on a Russian Soyuz-U rocket, using a modifiedProgress spacecraft,Progress M-SO1, as an upper stage. Pirs was undocked byProgress MS-16on 26 July 2021, 10:56 UTC, and deorbited on the same day at 14:51 UTC to make room for theNaukamodule to be attached to the space station. Prior to its departure, Pirs served as the primary Russian airlock on the station, being used to store and refurbish the Russian Orlan spacesuits. In January 2020, NASA awardedAxiom Spacea contract to build a commercial module for the ISS. The contract is under theNextSTEP2program. NASA negotiated with Axiom on a firmfixed-price contractbasis to build and deliver the module, which will attach to the forward port of the space station'sHarmony (Node 2)module. Although NASA only commissioned one module, Axiom planned to build an entire segment consisting of five modules, including a node module, an orbital research and manufacturing facility, a crew habitat, and a \"large-windowed Earth observatory\". The Axiom segment was expected to greatly increase the capabilities and value of the space station, allowing for larger crews and private spaceflight by other organisations. Axiom planned to convert the segment into a stand-alone space station once the ISS is decommissioned, with the intention that this would act as a successor to the ISS.Canadarm2is planned to continue its operations on Axiom Station after the retirement of ISS in 2030.In December 2024, Axiom Space revised their station assembly plans to require only one module to dock with the ISS before assembling Axiom Station in an independent orbit. As of December 2024[update], Axiom Space expects to launch one module, the Payload Power Thermal Module (PPTM), to the ISS no earlier than 2027.PPTM is expected to remain at the ISS until the launch of Axiom's Habitat One (Hab-1) module about one year later, after which it will detach from the ISS to join with Hab-1. TheUS Deorbit Vehicle(USDV) is a NASA-provided spacecraft intended to perform a controlled de-orbit and demise of the station after the end of its operational life in 2030. In June 2024, NASA awardedSpaceXa contract to build the Deorbit Vehicle.NASA plans to de-orbit ISS as soon as they have the \"minimum capability\" in orbit: \"the USDV and at least one commercial station.\" Several modules developed or planned for the station were cancelled over the course of the ISS programme. Reasons include budgetary constraints, the modules becoming unnecessary, and station redesigns after the 2003Columbiadisaster. The USCentrifuge Accommodations Modulewould have hosted science experiments in varying levels ofartificial gravity.The USHabitation Modulewould have served as the station's living quarters. Instead, the living quarters are now spread throughout the station.The USInterim Control ModuleandISS Propulsion Modulewould have replaced the functions ofZvezdain case of a launch failure.TwoRussian Research Moduleswere planned for scientific research.They would have docked to a RussianUniversal Docking Module.The RussianScience Power Platformwould have supplied power to the Russian Orbital Segment independent of the ITS solar arrays. Science Power Module 1(SPM-1, also known asNEM-1) andScience Power Module 2(SPM-2, also known asNEM-2) are modules that were originally planned to arrive at the ISS no earlier than 2024, and dock to thePrichalmodule, which is docked to theNaukamodule.In April 2021, Roscosmos announced that NEM-1 would be repurposed to function as the core module of the proposedRussian Orbital Service Station(ROSS), launching no earlier than 2027and docking to the free-flyingNaukamodule.NEM-2 may be converted into another core \"base\" module, which would be launched in 2028. Designed byBigelow Aerospace. In August 2016, Bigelow negotiated an agreement with NASA to develop a full-size ground prototype Deep Space Habitation based on the B330 under the second phase of Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships. The module was called the Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE), as Bigelow hoped to test the module by attaching it to the International Space Station. However, in March 2020, Bigelow laid off all 88 of its employees, and as of February 2024[update]the company remains dormant and is considered defunct,making it appear unlikely that the XBASE module will ever be launched. A proposal was put forward in 2011 for a first in-space demonstration of a sufficiently scaled centrifuge for artificial partial-g gravity effects. It was designed to become a sleep module for the ISS crew. The project was cancelled in favour of other projects due to budget constraints. The critical systems are the atmosphere control system, the water supply system, the food supply facilities, the sanitation and hygiene equipment, and fire detection and suppression equipment. The Russian Orbital Segment's life-support systems are contained in theZvezdaservice module. Some of these systems are supplemented by equipment in the USOS. TheNaukalaboratory has a complete set of life-support systems. The atmosphere on board the ISS is similar tothat of Earth.Normal air pressure on the ISS is 101.3 kPa (14.69 psi);the same as at sea level on Earth. An Earth-like atmosphere offers benefits for crew comfort, and is much safer than a pure oxygen atmosphere, because of the increased risk of a fire such as that responsible for the deaths of theApollo 1crew.[better source needed]Earth-like atmospheric conditions have been maintained on all Russian and Soviet spacecraft. TheElektronsystem aboardZvezdaand a similar system inDestinygenerate oxygen aboard the station.The crew has a backup option in the form of bottled oxygen andSolid Fuel Oxygen Generation(SFOG) canisters, achemical oxygen generatorsystem.Carbon dioxide is removed from the air by theVozdukhsystem inZvezda. Other by-products of human metabolism, such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat, are removed byactivated charcoalfilters. Part of the ROS atmosphere control system is the oxygen supply. Triple-redundancy is provided by the Elektron unit, solid fuel generators, and stored oxygen. The primary supply of oxygen is the Elektron unit which producesO2andH2byelectrolysisof water and ventsH2overboard. The 1 kW (1.3 hp) system uses approximately one litre of water per crew member per day. This water is either brought from Earth or recycled from other systems.Mirwas the first spacecraft to use recycled water for oxygen production. The secondary oxygen supply is provided by burning oxygen-producingVikacartridges (see alsoISS ECLSS). Each 'candle' takes 5–20 minutes to decompose at 450–500 °C (842–932 °F), producing 600 litres (130 imp gal; 160 US gal) ofO2. This unit is manually operated. The US Orbital Segment (USOS) has redundant supplies of oxygen, from a pressurised storage tank on theQuestairlock module delivered in 2001, supplemented ten years later by ESA-built Advanced Closed-Loop System (ACLS) in theTranquilitymodule (Node 3), which producesO2by electrolysis.Hydrogen produced is combined with carbon dioxide from the cabin atmosphere and converted to water and methane. Double-sidedsolar arraysprovideelectrical powerto the ISS. These bifacial cells collect direct sunlight on one side and lightreflected offfrom the Earth on the other, and are more efficient and operate at a lower temperature than single-sided cells commonly used on Earth. The Russian segment of the station, like most spacecraft, uses 28Vlow voltageDCfrom two rotating solar arrays mounted onZvezda. The USOS uses 130–180 V DC from the USOS PV array. Power is stabilised and distributed at 160 V DC and converted to the user-required 124 V DC. Thehigher distribution voltageallows smaller, lighter conductors, at the expense of crew safety. The two station segments share power with converters. The USOS solar arrays are arranged as four wing pairs, for a total production of 75 to 90 kilowatts.These arrays normally track the Sun to maximise power generation. Each array is about 375 m2(4,036 sq ft) in area and 58 m (190 ft) long. In the complete configuration, the solar arrays track the Sun by rotating thealphagimbalonce per orbit; thebeta gimbalfollows slower changes in the angle of the Sun to the orbital plane. TheNight Glider modealigns the solar arrays parallel to the ground at night to reduce the significant aerodynamic drag at the station's relatively low orbital altitude. The station originally used rechargeablenickel–hydrogen batteries(NiH2) for continuous power during the 45 minutes of every 90-minute orbit that it is eclipsed by the Earth. The batteries are recharged on the day side of the orbit. They had a 6.5-year lifetime (over 37,000 charge/discharge cycles) and were regularly replaced over the anticipated 20-year life of the station.Starting in 2016, the nickel–hydrogen batteries were replaced bylithium-ion batteries, which are expected to last until the end of the ISS program. The station's large solar panels generate a high potential voltage difference between the station and the ionosphere. This could cause arcing through insulating surfaces and sputtering of conductive surfaces as ions are accelerated by the spacecraft plasma sheath. To mitigate this,plasma contactorunits create current paths between the station and the ambient space plasma. The station's systems and experiments consume a large amount of electrical power, almost all of which is converted to heat. To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquidammonialoop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then the ammonia is cycled back to the station.The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, includingKibōandColumbus, as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70 kW. This is much more than the 14 kW of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched onSTS-105and installed onto the P6 Truss. The ISS relies on various radio communication systems to providetelemetryand scientific data links between the station andmission control centres. Radio links are also used duringrendezvous and docking proceduresand for audio and video communication between crew members, flight controllers and family members. As a result, the ISS is equipped with internal and external communication systems used for different purposes. The Russian Orbital Segment primarily uses theLiraantenna mounted onZvezdafor direct ground communication.It also had the capability to utilize theLuchdata relay satellite system,which was in a state of disrepair when the station was built,but was restored to operational status in 2011 and 2012 with the launch of Luch-5A and Luch-5B.Additionally, theVoskhod-Msystem provides internal telephone communications and VHF radio links to ground control. TheUS Orbital Segment(USOS) makes use of two separate radio links:S band(audio, telemetry, commanding – located on the P1/S1 truss) andKuband(audio, video and data – located on theZ1 truss) systems. These transmissions are routed via the United StatesTracking and Data Relay SatelliteSystem (TDRSS) ingeostationary orbit, allowing for almost continuous real-time communications withChristopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center(MCC-H) inHouston, Texas.Data channels for the Canadarm2, EuropeanColumbuslaboratory and JapaneseKibōmodules were originally also routed via the S band and Kuband systems, with theEuropean Data Relay Systemand a similar Japanese system intended to eventually complement the TDRSS in this role. UHF radiois used by astronauts and cosmonauts conducting EVAs and other spacecraft that dock to or undock from the station.Automated spacecraft are fitted with their own communications equipment; the ATV used alaserattached to the spacecraft and the Proximity Communications Equipment attached toZvezdato accurately dock with the station. The US Orbital Segment of the ISS is equipped with approximately 100commercial off-the-shelflaptops running Windows or Linux.These devices are modified to use the station's 28V DC power system and with additional ventilation since heat generated by the devices can stagnate in the weightless environment. NASA prefers to keep a high commonality between laptops and spare parts are kept on the station so astronauts can repair laptops when needed. The laptops are divided into two groups: the Portable Computer System (PCS) and Station Support Computers (SSC). PCS laptops run Linux and are used for connecting to the station's primary Command & Control computer (C&C MDM), which runs onDebianLinux,a switch made from Windows in 2013 for reliability and flexibility.The primary computer supervises the critical systems that keep the station in orbit and supporting life.Since the primary computer has no display or keyboards, astronauts use a PCS laptop to connect as remote terminals via a USB to1553adapter.The primary computer experienced failures in 2001,2007,and 2017. The 2017 failure required a spacewalk to replace external components. SSC laptops are used for everything else on the station, including reviewing procedures, managing scientific experiments, communicating over e-mail or video chat, and for entertainment during downtime.SSC laptops connect to the station'swireless LANviaWi-Fi, which connects to the ground via the Kuband. While originally this provided speeds of 10Mbit/sdownload and 3 Mbit/s upload from the station,NASA upgraded the system in 2019 and increased the speeds to 600 Mbit/s.ISS crew members have access to theinternet. Each permanent crew is given an expedition number. Expeditions run up to six months, from launch until undocking, an 'increment' covers the same time period, but includes cargo spacecraft and all activities. Expeditions 1 to 6 consisted of three-person crews. After the destruction of NASA's Space ShuttleColumbia, Expeditions 7 to 12 were reduced to two-person \"caretaker\" crews who could maintain the station, because a larger crew could not be fully resupplied by the small Russian Progress cargo spacecraft.After the Shuttle fleet returned to flight, three person crews also returned to the ISS beginning with Expedition 13. As the Shuttle flights expanded the station, crew sizes also expanded, eventually reaching six around 2010.With the arrival of crew on larger UScommercial spacecraftbeginning in 2020,crew size has been increased to seven, the number for which ISS was originally designed. Oleg Kononenkoof Roscosmos holds the record for the longest time spent in space and at the ISS, accumulating nearly 1,111 days in space over the course of five long-duration missions on the ISS (Expedition 17,30/31,44/45,57/58/59and69/70/71). He also served as commander three times (Expedition 31, 58/59 and 70/71). Peggy Whitsonof NASA andAxiom Spacehas spent the most time in space of any American, accumulating over 675 days in space during her time on Expeditions5,16, and50/51/52and Axiom Missions2and4. Travellers who pay for their own passage into space are termedspaceflight participantsby Roscosmos and NASA, and are sometimes referred to as \"space tourists\", a term they generally dislike.[f]As of June 2023[update], thirteen space tourists have visited the ISS; nine were transported to the ISS on Russian Soyuz spacecraft, and four were transported on AmericanSpaceX Dragon 2spacecraft. For one-tourist missions, when professional crews change over in numbers not divisible by the three seats in a Soyuz, and a short-stay crewmember is not sent, the spare seat is sold by MirCorp through Space Adventures. Space tourism was halted in 2011 when the Space Shuttle was retired and the station's crew size was reduced to six, as the partners relied on Russian transport seats for access to the station. Soyuz flight schedules increased after 2013, allowing five Soyuz flights (15 seats) with only two expeditions (12 seats) required.The remaining seats were to be sold for around US$40 million each to members of the public who could pass a medical exam. ESA and NASA criticised private spaceflight at the beginning of the ISS, and NASA initially resisted trainingDennis Tito, the first person to pay for his own passage to the ISS.[g] Anousheh Ansaribecame the first self-funded woman to fly to the ISS as well as the first Iranian in space. Officials reported that her education and experience made her much more than a tourist, and her performance in training had been \"excellent.\"She did Russian and European studies involving medicine and microbiology during her 10-day stay. The 2009 documentarySpace Touristsfollows her journey to the station, where she fulfilled \"an age-old dream of man: to leave our planet as a 'normal person' and travel into outer space.\" In 2008, spaceflight participantRichard Garriottplaced ageocacheaboard the ISS during his flight.This is the first non-terrestrial geocache in history.At the same time, theImmortality Drive, an electronic record of eight digitised humanDNA sequences, was placed aboard the ISS. After a 12-year hiatus, the first two wholly space tourism-dedicated private spaceflights to the ISS were undertaken.Soyuz MS-20launched in December 2021, carrying visiting Roscosmos cosmonautAlexander Misurkinand two Japanese space tourists under the aegis of the private companySpace Adventures;in April 2022, the companyAxiom Spacechartered aSpaceX Dragon 2spacecraft and sent its own employee astronautMichael Lopez-Alegriaand three space tourists to the ISS forAxiom Mission 1,followed in May 2023 by one more tourist,John Shoffner, alongside employee astronautPeggy Whitsonand two Saudi astronauts for theAxiom Mission 2. The first all private astronaut mission (PAM) to the ISS wasAxiom Mission 1, which launched in April, 2022.After evaluating previous flights to ISS which included private spaceflight participants, and the first three flights including only private astronauts, NASA updated requirements for entities providing PAMs.As of August 2025[update]the most recent mission wasAxiom Mission 4. NASA intends to offer up to two PAM opportunities per year. Various crewed and uncrewed spacecraft have supported the station's operations. Flights to the ISS have included 93 Progress,[h]72 Soyuz, 50SpaceX Dragon[i]37 Space Shuttle, 21Cygnus, 9HTV, 5ATV, and 2Boeing Starlinermissions. There are currently eight docking ports for visiting spacecraft, with four additional ports installed but not yet put into service: Forwardports are at the front of the station in its usual orientation and direction of travel.Aftis the opposite, at the rear.Nadirpoints toward Earth, whilezenithpoints away from it.Portis to the left andstarboardto the right when one's feet are toward Earth and one is facing forward, in the direction of travel. Cargo spacecraft that will perform an orbital re-boost of the station will typically dock at an aft, forward or nadir-facing port. As of 4 August 2025[ref], a total of 290 individuals from 26 countries had visited the International Space Station (ISS), including both government-sponsored astronauts and privately funded spaceflight participants. The United States accounted for 170 of these visitors, followed by Russia with 64, Japan with 11, andCanadawith 9.Italyhad 6 visitors, whileFranceandGermanyhad each sent 4.Saudi Arabia,Sweden, and theUnited Arab Emirateseach had 2 individuals visit the ISS. One person had traveled to the ISS from each of the following countries:Belarus,Belgium,Brazil,Denmark,Hungary,India,Israel,Kazakhstan,Malaysia, theNetherlands,Poland,South Africa,South Korea,Spain,Turkey, and theUnited Kingdom. Uncrewed spaceflights are primarily used to deliver cargo to the station including crew supplies, scientific investigations, spacewalk equipment, vehicle hardware, propellant, water, and gases. Cargo resupply missions have typically used Russian Progress spacecraft, the now-retired European ATV, the Japanese HTV, and American Dragon and Cygnus spacecraft. Additionally, several Russian modules have been launched on uncrewed rockets and autonomously docked with the station. All dates areUTC. Departure dates are the earliest possible (NET) and may change. All dates areUTC. Launch dates are the earliest possible (NET) and may change. Russian spacecraft can autonomously rendezvous and dock with the station without human intervention. Once within about 200 kilometres (120 mi) the spacecraft activates itsKurs docking navigation system, exchanging radio signals with the station's beacon to guide orbital manoeuvres. As it closes in, more accurate transceivers align the craft with the docking port and control the final approach. The crew supervises the procedure and can intervene using theTORU(Tele-robotically Operated Rendezvous Unit) system if required.Automated docking has been used by the Soviet programme since 1967, with Kurs introduced onMirin 1986 and refined since. Though costly to develop, its reliability and standardised components have delivered significant long-term savings. The AmericanSpaceX Dragon 2cargo and crewed spacecraft can autonomously rendezvous and dock with the station without human intervention. However, on crewed Dragon missions, the astronauts have the capability to intervene and fly the vehicle manually. Otherautomated cargo spacecrafttypically use a semi-automated process when arriving and departing from the station. These spacecraft are instructed to approach and park near the station. Once the crew on board the station is ready, the spacecraft is commanded to come close to the station, so that it can be grappled by an astronaut using theMobile Servicing Systemrobotic arm. The final mating of the spacecraft to the station is achieved using the robotic arm (a process known as berthing). Spacecraft using this semi-automated process include the AmericanCygnusand the JapaneseHTV-X. The now-retired AmericanSpaceX Dragon 1, EuropeanATVand JapaneseHTValso used this process. Prior to a spacecraft's docking to the ISS, navigation and attitude control (GNC) is handed over to the ground control of the spacecraft's country of origin. GNC is set to allow the station to drift in space, rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes. The solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming spacecraft, so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells. Before its retirement, Shuttle launches were often given priority over Soyuz, with occasional priority given to Soyuz arrivals carrying crew and time-critical cargoes, such as biological experiment materials. Orbital Replacement Units(ORUs) are spare parts that can be readily replaced when a unit either passes its design life or fails. Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets calledExPRESS Logistics Carriers(ELCs) or share larger platforms calledExternal Stowage Platforms(ESPs) which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, Cygnus and Dragon, carry one tenth to one quarter the payload. Unexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons. Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004,the venting of fumes from anElektronoxygen generator in 2006,and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 duringSTS-117that left the station without thruster,Elektron,Vozdukhand other environmental control system operations. In the latter case, the root cause was found to be condensation inside electrical connectors leading to a short circuit. During STS-120 in 2007 and following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays, it was noted during unfurling that the solar array had torn and was not deploying properly.An EVA was carried out byScott Parazynski, assisted byDouglas Wheelock. Extra precautions were taken to reduce the risk of electric shock, as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight.The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station. Excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array drive motor were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 andSTS-123showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic bearing surfaces, so the joint was locked to prevent further damage.Repairs to the joints were carried out duringSTS-126with lubrication and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint. In September 2008, damage to the S1 radiator was first noticed in Soyuz imagery. The problem was initially not thought to be serious.The imagery showed that the surface of one sub-panel had peeled back from the underlying central structure, possibly because of micro-meteoroid or debris impact. On 15 May 2009, the damaged radiator panel's ammonia tubing was mechanically shut off from the rest of the cooling system by the computer-controlled closure of a valve. The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak.It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, but its effect, if any, has not been determined. In the early hours of 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid. Several subsystems, including two of the four CMGs, were shut down. Planned operations on the ISS were interrupted through a series of EVAs to address the cooling system issue. A first EVA on 7 August 2010, to replace the failed pump module, was not fully completed because of an ammonia leak in one of four quick-disconnects. A second EVA on 11 August removed the failed pump module.A third EVA was required to restore Loop A to normal functionality. The USOS's cooling system is largely built by the US company Boeing,which is also the manufacturer of the failed pump. The four Main Bus Switching Units (MBSUs, located in the S0 truss), control the routing of power from the four solar array wings to the rest of the ISS. Each MBSU has two power channels that feed 160V DC from the arrays to two DC-to-DC power converters (DDCUs) that supply the 124V power used in the station. In late 2011, MBSU-1 ceased responding to commands or sending data confirming its health. While still routing power correctly, it was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available EVA. A spare MBSU was already on board, but a 30 August 2012 EVA failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before the electrical connection was secured.The loss of MBSU-1 limited the station to 75% of its normal power capacity, requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem could be addressed. On 5 September 2012, in a second six-hour EVA, astronauts Sunita Williams and Akihiko Hoshide successfully replaced MBSU-1 and restored the ISS to 100% power. On 24 December 2013, astronauts installed a new ammonia pump for the station's cooling system. The faulty cooling system had failed earlier in the month, halting many of the station's science experiments. Astronauts had to brave a \"mini blizzard\" of ammonia while installing the new pump. It was only the second Christmas Eve spacewalk in NASA history. The components of the ISS are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies atmission control centresacross the globe, primarily theChristopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Centerin Houston and theRKA Mission Control Center(TsUP) in Moscow, with support fromTsukuba Space Centerin Japan,Payload Operations and Integration Centerin Huntsville, Alabama, U.S.,Columbus Control Centerin Munich, Germany andMobile Servicing SystemControl at theCanadian Space Agency's headquarters inSaint-Hubert, Quebec. The ISS is currently maintained in a nearly circular orbit with a minimum mean altitude of 370 km (230 mi) and a maximum of 460 km (290 mi),in the centre of thethermosphere, at aninclinationof 51.6 degrees to Earth's equatorwith an eccentricity of 0.0002267.[needs update]This orbit was selected because it is the lowest inclination that can be directly reached by Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft launched fromBaikonur Cosmodromeat 46° N latitude without overflying China or dropping spent rocket stages in inhabited areas.It travels at an average speed of 28,000 kilometres per hour (17,000 mph), and completes 15.5 orbits per day (93 minutes per orbit).The station's altitude was allowed to fall around the time of each NASA shuttle flight to permit heavier loads to be transferred to the station. After the retirement of the shuttle, the nominal orbit of the space station was raised in altitude (from about 350 km to about 400 km).Other, more frequent supply spacecraft do not require this adjustment as they are substantially higher performance vehicles. Atmospheric drag reduces the altitude by about 2 km a month on average. Orbital boosting can be performed by the station's two main engines on theZvezdaservice module, or Russian or European spacecraft docked toZvezda'saft port. The Automated Transfer Vehicle is constructed with the possibility of adding asecond docking portto its aft end, allowing other craft to dock and boost the station. It takes approximately two orbits (three hours) for the boost to a higher altitude to be completed.Maintaining ISS altitude uses about 7.5 tonnes of chemical fuel per annumat an annual cost of about $210 million. The Russian Orbital Segment contains the Data Management System, which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control (ROS GNC) for the entire station.Initially,Zarya, the first module of the station, controlled the station until a short time after the Russian service moduleZvezdadocked and was transferred control.Zvezdacontains the ESA built DMS-R Data Management System.Using two fault-tolerant computers (FTC),Zvezdacomputes the station's position and orbital trajectory using redundant Earth horizon sensors, Solar horizon sensors as well as Sun and star trackers. The FTCs each contain three identical processing units working in parallel and provide advanced fault-masking by majority voting. Zvezdauses gyroscopes (reaction wheels) and thrusters to turn itself. Gyroscopes do not require propellant; instead they use electricity to 'store' momentum in flywheels by turning in the opposite direction to the station's movement. The USOS has its own computer-controlled gyroscopes to handle its extra mass. When gyroscopes'saturate', thrusters are used to cancel out the stored momentum. In February 2005, during Expedition 10, an incorrect command was sent to the station's computer, using about 14 kilograms of propellant before the fault was noticed and fixed. When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, this can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which itself has no thrusters. Docked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude, such as for troubleshooting or during theinstallation of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics. The low altitudes at which the ISS orbits are also home to a variety of space debris,including spent rocket stages, defunct satellites, explosion fragments (including materials fromanti-satellite weapontests), paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, and coolant released byUS-Anuclear-powered satellites. These objects, in addition to naturalmicrometeoroids,are a significant threat. Objects large enough to destroy the station can be tracked, and therefore are not as dangerous as smaller debris.Objects too small to be detected by optical and radar instruments, from approximately 1 cm down to microscopic size, number in the trillions. Despite their small size, some of these objects are a threat because of theirkinetic energyand direction in relation to the station. Spacewalking crew in spacesuits are also at risk of suit damage and consequentexposure to vacuum. Ballistic panels, also called micrometeorite shielding, are incorporated into the station to protect pressurised sections and critical systems. The type and thickness of these panels depend on their predicted exposure to damage. The station's shields and structure have different designs on the ROS and the USOS. On the USOS,Whipple Shieldsare used. The US segment modules consist of an inner layer made from 1.5–5.0 cm-thick (0.59–1.97 in)aluminium, a 10 cm-thick (3.9 in) intermediate layers ofKevlarand Nextel (a ceramic fabric),and an outer layer ofstainless steel, which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact. On the ROS, acarbon fibre reinforced polymerhoneycomb screen is spaced from the hull, an aluminium honeycomb screen is spaced from that, with a screen-vacuum thermal insulation covering, and glass cloth over the top. Space debris is tracked remotely from the ground, and the station crew can be notified.If necessary, thrusters on the Russian Orbital Segment can alter the station's orbital altitude, avoiding the debris. TheseDebris Avoidance Manoeuvres(DAMs) are not uncommon, taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance. Ten DAMs had been performed by the end of 2009.Usually, an increase in orbital velocity of the order of 1 m/s is used to raise the orbit by one or two kilometres. If necessary, the altitude can also be lowered, although such a manoeuvre wastes propellant.If a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a DAM to be safely conducted, the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their spacecraft in order to be able to evacuate in the event the station was seriously damaged by the debris. Partial station evacuations have occurred on 13 March 2009, 28 June 2011, 24 March 2012, 16 June 2015,November 2021,and27 June 2024. The November 2021 evacuation was caused by a Russian anti-satelliteweapon test.NASA administratorBill Nelsonsaid it was unthinkable that Russia would endanger the lives of everyone on ISS, including their own cosmonauts. The ISS is visible in theskyto thenaked eyeas a visibly moving, bright white dot, when crossing the sky and being illuminated by the Sun, duringtwilight, the hours after sunset and before sunrise, when the station remains sunlit, outside ofEarth's shadow, but the ground and sky are dark.It crosses the skies at latitudes between thepolar regions.Depending on the path it takes across the sky, the time it takes the station to move across the horizon or from one to the other may be short or up to 10 minutes, while likely being only visible part of that time because of it moving into or out of Earth's shadow. It then returns around every 90 minutes, with the time of the day that it crosses the sky shifting over the course of some weeks, and therefore before returning to twilight and visible illumination. Because of the size of its reflective surface area, the ISS is the brightest artificial object in the sky (excluding othersatellite flares), with an approximate maximummagnitudeof −4 when in sunlight and overhead (similar toVenus), and a maximumangular sizeof 63 arcseconds. Tools are provided by a number of websites such asHeavens-Above(seeLive viewingbelow) as well assmartphoneapplications that useorbital dataand the observer's longitude and latitude to indicate when the ISS will be visible (weather permitting), where the station will appear to rise, the altitude above the horizon it will reach and the duration of the pass before the station disappears either by setting below the horizon or entering into Earth's shadow. In November 2012 NASA launched its \"Spot the Station\" service, which sends people text and email alerts when the station is due to fly above their town.The station is visible from 95% of the inhabited land on Earth, but is not visible from extreme northern or southern latitudes. Under specific conditions, the ISS can be observed at night on five consecutive orbits. Those conditions are 1) a mid-latitude observer location, 2) near the time of the solstice with 3) the ISS passing in the direction of the pole from the observer near midnight local time. The three photos show the first, middle and last of the five passes on 5–6 June 2014. Using a telescope-mounted camera to photograph the station is a popular hobby for astronomers,while using a mounted camera to photograph the Earth and stars is a popular hobby for crew.The use of a telescope or binoculars allows viewing of the ISS during daylight hours. Transitsof the ISS in front of the Sun, particularly during aneclipse(and so the Earth, Sun, Moon, and ISS are all positioned approximately in a single line) are of particular interest for amateur astronomers. Gravity at the altitude of the ISS is approximately 90% as strong as at Earth's surface, but objects in orbit are in a continuous state offreefall, resulting in an apparent state ofweightlessness.This perceived weightlessness is disturbed by five effects: The ISS is partially protected from the space environment byEarth's magnetic field. From an average distance of about 70,000 km (43,000 mi) from the Earth's surface, depending on Solar activity, themagnetospherebegins to deflectsolar windaround Earth and the space station.Solar flaresare still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial \"proton storm\" of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew ofExpedition 10took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the ROS designed for this purpose. Subatomic charged particles, primarilyprotonsfrom cosmic rays and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called anaurora. Outside Earth's atmosphere, ISS crews are exposed to approximately onemillisieverteach day (about a year's worth of natural exposure on Earth), resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the DNA andchromosomesoflymphocytes; being central to theimmune system, any damage to these cells could contribute to the lowerimmunityexperienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence ofcataractsin astronauts. Protective shielding and medications may lower the risks to an acceptable level. Radiation levels on the ISS are between 12 and 28.8 milli rads per day,about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other types of radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight, an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; this is one fifth the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while the ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay on board the station. Hazardous molds that can foul air and water filters may develop aboard space stations. They can produce acids that degrade metal, glass, and rubber. They can also be harmful to the crew's health. Microbiological hazards have led to a development of theLOCAD-PTS(a portable test system) which identifies common bacteria and molds faster than standard methods ofculturing, which may require a sample to be sent back to Earth.Researchers in 2018 reported, after detecting the presence of fiveEnterobacter bugandensisbacterial strains on the ISS (none of which arepathogenicto humans), that microorganisms on the ISS should be carefully monitored to continue assuring a medically healthy environment for astronauts. Contamination on space stations can be prevented by reduced humidity, and by using paint that contains mold-killing chemicals, as well as the use of antiseptic solutions. All materials used in the ISS are tested for resistance againstfungi.Since 2016, a series of ESA-sponsored experiments have been conducted to test the anti-bacterial properties of various materials, with the goal of developing \"smart surfaces\" that mitigate bacterial growth in multiple ways, using the best method for a particular circumstance. Dubbed \"Microbial Aerosol Tethering on Innovative Surfaces\" (MATISS), the programme involves deployment of small plaques containing an array of glass squares covered with different test coatings. They remain on the station for six months before being returned to earth for analysis.The most recent and final experiment of the series was launched on 5 June 2023 aboard theSpaceX CRS-28cargo mission to ISS, comprising four plaques. Whereas previous experiments in the series were limited to analysis bylight microsocopy, this experiment uses quartz glass made of pure silica, which will allowspectrographic analysis. Two of the plaques were returned after eight months and the remaining two after 16 months. In April 2019, NASA reported that a comprehensive study had been conducted into the microorganisms and fungi present on the ISS. The experiment was performed over a period of 14 months on three different flight missions, and involved taking samples from 8 predefined locations inside the station, then returning them to earth for analysis. In prior experiments, analysis was limited to culture-based methods, thus overlooking microbes which cannot be grown in culture. The present study usedmolecular-based methods in addition to culturing, resulting in a more complete catalog. The results may be useful in improving the health and safety conditions for astronauts, as well as better understanding other closed-in environments on Earth such as clean rooms used by the pharmaceutical and medical industries. Space flight is not inherently quiet, with noise levels exceeding acoustic standards as far back as theApollo missions.For this reason, NASA and the International Space Station international partners have developednoise controlandhearing lossprevention goals as part of the health program for crew members. Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.The effort includes contributions fromacoustical engineers,audiologists,industrial hygienists, and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, Roscosmos, the European Space Agency (ESA), the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). When compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels experienced by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to theOccupational Safety and Health Administration– rarely reaching 85 dBA. But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging six months in duration. These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarmaudibility. Over the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS. During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose the quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.: 5.7.3During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards. The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS. The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials,noise barriers, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels, this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducingambient noise levels. NASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from theNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthand theWorld Health Organization), in order to protect all crew members. The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits. One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need forhearing protection devices(HPDs). Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, appliesengineering controls, and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions. There have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received theSafe-In-Sound Awardfor Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise. An onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards. Ammonia is used in the external radiators of the station and could potentially leak into the pressurised modules. On 12 April 2019, NASA reported medical results from theAstronaut Twin Study. AstronautScott Kellyspent a year in space on the ISS, whilehis identical twinspent the year on Earth. Several long-lasting changes were observed, including those related to alterations inDNAandcognition, when one twin was compared with the other. In November 2019, researchers reported that astronauts experienced seriousblood flowandclotproblems while on board the ISS, based on a six-month study of 11 healthy astronauts. The results may influence long-term spaceflight, including a mission to the planet Mars, according to the researchers. There is considerable evidence thatpsychosocialstressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.CosmonautValery Ryuminwrote in his journal during a particularly difficult period on board theSalyut6space station: \"All the conditions necessary for murder are met if you shut two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 [5.5 m × 6 m] and leave them together for two months.\" NASA's interest inpsychological stresscaused by space travel, initially studied when their crewed missions began, was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the Russian space stationMir. Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA astronautDaniel Tanidied in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child. A study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months. The ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language. First-generation space stations had crews who spoke a single language; second- and third-generation stations have crew from many cultures who speak many languages. Astronauts must speak English and Russian, and knowing additional languages is even better. Due to the lack of gravity, confusion often occurs. Even though there is no up and down in space, some crew members feel like they are oriented upside down. They may also have difficulty measuring distances. This can cause problems like getting lost inside the space station, pulling switches in the wrong direction or misjudging the speed of an approaching vehicle during docking. Thephysiologicaleffects of long-term weightlessness includemuscle atrophy, deterioration of the skeleton (osteopenia), fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, and puffiness of the face. Sleep is regularly disturbed on the ISS because of mission demands, such as incoming or departing spacecraft. Sound levels in the station are unavoidably high. The atmosphere is unable tothermosiphonnaturally, so fans are required at all times to process the air which would stagnate in the freefall (zero-G) environment. To prevent some of the adverse effects on the body, the station is equipped with: twoTVIStreadmills (including the COLBERT); theARED(Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), which enables various weightlifting exercises that add muscle without raising (or compensating for) the astronauts' reduced bone density;and a stationary bicycle. Each astronaut spends at least two hours per day exercising on the equipment.Astronauts use bungee cords to strap themselves to the treadmill. The living and working space aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is larger than a six-bedroom house, equipped with seven private sleeping quarters, three bathrooms, two dining rooms, a gym, and a panoramic 360-degree-view bay window. The station provides dedicated crew quarters for long-term crew members. Two are located inZvezda, one inNauka, and four inHarmony.These soundproof, person-sized booths offer privacy, ventilation, and basic amenities such as a sleeping bag, a reading lamp, and storage for personal items.The quarters inZvezdainclude a small window but have less ventilation and soundproofing. Visiting crew members use tethered sleeping bags attached to available wall space or inside their spacecraft. While it is possible to sleep floating freely, this is generally avoided to prevent collisions with sensitive equipment.Proper ventilation is critical, as astronauts risk oxygen deprivation if exhaled carbon dioxide accumulates in a bubble around their heads. The station's lighting system is adjustable, allowing for dimming, switching off, andcolour temperaturechanges to support crew activities and rest. The ISS operates onCoordinated Universal Time(UTC).A typical day aboard the ISS begins at 06:00 with wake-up, post-sleep routines, and a morning inspection of the station. After breakfast, the crew holds a daily planning conference with Mission Control, starting work around 08:10. Morning tasks include scheduled exercise, scientific experiments, maintenance, or operational duties. Following a one-hour lunch break at 13:05, the crew resumes their afternoon schedule of work and exercise. Pre-sleep activities, including dinner and a crew conference, begin at 19:30, with the scheduled sleep period starting at 21:30. The crew works approximately 10 hours on weekdays and 5 hours on Saturdays, with the remaining time allocated for relaxation or catching up on tasks. Free time often involves enjoying personal hobbies, communicating with family, or gazing out at Earth through the station's windows.The crew can watch TV aboard the station. When the Space Shuttle was operating, the ISS crew aligned with the shuttle crew'sMission Elapsed Time, a flexible schedule based on the shuttle's launch. To simulate night conditions, the station's windows are covered during designated sleep periods, as the ISS experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets daily due to its orbital speed. Reflection of individual and crew characteristics are found particularly in the decoration of the station and expressions in general, such as religion.The latter has produced a certain material economy between the station and Russia in particular. The micro-society of the station, as well as wider society, and possibly the emergence of distinct station cultures,is being studied by analyzing many aspects, from art to dust accumulation, as well as archaeologically how material of the ISS has been discarded. Food aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is preserved and packaged to withstand long storage times, minimize waste, and prevent contamination of station systems. Because microgravity dulls taste, meals are often seasoned more heavily than on Earth.Crews particularly look forward to resupply missions, which deliver perishable items such as fresh fruit and vegetables. To reduce the risk of crumbs and spills damaging equipment, foods are prepared in specialized packaging, liquid condiments are preferred over powdered ones, and containers are secured with Velcro or magnets. Drinks are delivered as powders to be mixed with water, while soups and beverages are sipped from plastic bags with straws.Solid foods are eaten with utensils attached to trays by magnets, and any stray food must be collected to prevent it from clogging air filters and other systems. The firstgalleywas installed inZvezda, equipped with an electro-resistive can warmer and a water dispenser for both hot and ambient water. Many Russian meals are still packaged incans, which are eaten directly, while others are provided inretort pouchesrehydrated with the water dispenser. A second galley was later added toUnityto support the station's larger crew. It contains two briefcase-shaped food warmers, a refrigerator (added in 2008), and a water dispenser.Most food in the U.S. Orbital Segment is packaged in retort pouches, which are rehydrated if necessary and heated or chilled in a food warmer or refrigerator as desired. While crews occasionally gather for group meals inUnity, especially during holidays or special occasions, they more often eat in small groups because of differing schedules. Russian cosmonauts also retain the option of dining separately inZvezda, where the can warmer is located. With the growing diversity of NASA's astronaut corps and the large number of international astronauts who have flown to the ISS, the variety of food available has expanded significantly. Efforts are made to provide meals that reflect astronauts' cultural backgrounds and personal preferences, and food is often shared among crew members. Experiments have also been conducted aboard the ISS to grow fresh vegetables in orbit.These studies aim to supplement astronauts' diets with additional nutrients, provide psychological benefits, and advance space agricultural techniques needed for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.As of 2023, crops grown include three types oflettuce,Chinese cabbage,mizuna mustard, and red Russiankale.Some of the plants are harvested and eaten by the crew, while others were returned to Earth for analysis. In the future, NASA plans to grow tomatoes andpeppers, and eventually berries, beans, and other nutrient-rich foods. Such crops could offer not only improved nutrition, but also potential protection against space radiation for crew members who consume them. The ISS is equipped with three Russian-designed toilets, located inZvezda,TranquilityandNauka.Inside these \"Waste and Hygiene Compartments\" the occupant fastens themselves to the toilet seat, which is equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a proper seal.A lever activates a powerful fan while opening a suction port at the bottom of the toilet bowl, and the airstream carries waste away. Solid waste is stored in individual bags placed in an aluminium container, which is later transferred to cargo spacecraft that will burn up on reentry.Liquid waste is collected through a hose with anatomically shaped funnel adapters so that both men and women can use the same system. Theurine is divertedto the Water Recovery System, where it is processed into drinking water. Showers were first introduced on space stations in the early 1970s aboardSkylabandSalyut3.: 139However, crews complained about the complexity of showering, and by the time ofSalyut 6in the early 1980s, it had been reduced to a monthly activity.The ISS, like later Russian stations after has no shower; instead, astronauts clean themselves with wet wipes or with a water jet and using soap dispensed from a toothpaste-like tube. Rinseless shampoo and edible toothpaste are also provided to conserve water. Originally the ISS was planned to be a 15-year mission.Therefore, an end of mission had been worked on,but was several times postponed due to the success and support for the operation of the station.As a result, the oldest modules of the ISS have been in orbit for more than 20 years, with their reliability having decreased.It has been proposed to use funds elsewhere instead, for example for a return to the Moon.According to theOuter Space Treaty, the parties are legally responsible for all spacecraft or modules they launch.Anunmaintained stationwould pose anorbitalandre-entryhazard. Russia has stated that it plans to pull out of the ISS program after 2025.However, Russian modules will provideorbital station-keepinguntil 2028. The US planned in 2009 to deorbit the ISS in 2016.But on 30 September 2015, Boeing's contract with NASA as prime contractor for the ISS was extended to 30 September 2020. Part of Boeing's services under the contract related to extending the station's primary structural hardware past 2020 to the end of 2028.In July 2018, the Space Frontier Act of 2018 was intended to extend operations of the ISS to 2030. This bill was unanimously approved in the Senate, but failed to pass in the U.S. House.In September 2018, the Leading Human Spaceflight Act was introduced with the intent to extend operations of the ISS to 2030, and was confirmed in December 2018.Congress later passed similar provisions in itsCHIPS and Science Act, signed into law by U.S. PresidentJoe Bidenon 9 August 2022. If until 2031Commercial LEO Destinations providersare not sufficient to accommodate NASA's projects, NASA is suggesting to extend ISS operations beyond 2031. NASA considered originally several possible disposal options: natural orbital decay with random reentry (as with Skylab), boosting the station to a higher altitude (which would delay reentry), and a controlled de-orbit targeting a remote ocean area. NASA determined that random reentry carried an unacceptable risk of producing hazardous space debris that could hit people or property and re-boosting the station would be costly and could also create hazards. Prior to 2010, plans had contemplated using a slightly modified Progress spacecraft to de-orbit the ISS. However, NASA concluded Progress would not be adequate for the job, and decided on a spacecraft specifically designed for the task. In January 2022, NASA announced a planned date of January 2031 to de-orbit the ISS using the \"U.S. Deorbit Vehicle\" and direct any remnants into a remote area of the South Pacific Ocean that has come to be known as thespacecraft cemetery.NASA plans to launch the deorbit vehicle in 2030, docking at the Harmony forward port.The deorbit vehicle will remain attached, dormant, for about a year as the station's orbit naturally decays to 220 km (140 mi). The spacecraft would then conduct one or more orientation burns to lower the perigee to 150 km (93 mi), followed by a final deorbiting burn. NASA began planning for the deorbit vehicle after becoming wary of Russia pulling out of the ISS abruptly, leaving the other partners with few good options for a controlled reentry.In June 2024, NASA selected SpaceX to develop the U.S. Deorbit Vehicle, a contract potentially worth $843 million. The vehicle will consist of an existingCargo Dragonspacecraft which will be paired with a significantly lengthenedtrunk modulewhich will be equipped with 46 Draco thrusters (instead of the normal 16) and will carry 30,000 kg (66,000 lb) of propellant, nearly six times the normal load. NASA is still working to secure all the necessary funding to build, launch and operate the deorbit vehicle. On 20 February 2025,Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX andSenior Advisor to President Trump, suggested in a tweet that the International Space Station be de-orbited \"two years from now\" as Musk believes the station has \"served its purpose\" and has \"very little incremental utility\". Despite this, no official decisions on moving up the de-orbiting date have been made yet by the president. The follow-up to NASA's program/strategy is theCommercial LEO Destinations Program, meant to allow private industry to build and maintain their own stations, and NASA procuring access as a customer, starting in 2028.Similarly, the ESA has been seeking new private space stations to provide orbital services, as well as retrieve materials, from the ISS.Axiom Stationis planned to begin as a single module temporarily hosted at the ISS in 2027.Additionally, there have been suggestions in the commercial space industry that the ISS could be converted to commercial operations after it is retired by government entities,including turning it into a space hotel. Russia previously has planned to use its orbital segment for the construction of itsOPSEKstation after the ISS is decommissioned. The modules under consideration for removal from the current ISS included the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (Nauka;MLM), launched in July 2021, and the other new Russian modules that are proposed to be attached toNauka. These newly launched modules would still be well within their useful lives in 2024.At the end of 2011, theExploration Gateway Platformconcept also proposed using leftover USOS hardware andZvezda 2as a refuelling depot and service station located at one of the Earth–MoonLagrange points. However, the entire USOS was not designed for disassembly and will be discarded. Western space industry has suggested in 2022 using the ISS as a platform to develop orbital salvage capacities, by companies such as CisLunar Industries working on using space debris as fuel,instead of plunging it into the ocean. NASA has stated that by July 2024 it has not seen any viable proposals for reuse of the ISS or parts of it. The ISS has been described as themost expensive single itemever constructed.As of 2010, the total cost was US$150 billion. This includesNASA's budget of $58.7 billion ($89.73 billion in 2021 dollars) for the station from 1985 to 2015, Russia's $12 billion, Europe's $5 billion, Japan's $5 billion, Canada's $2 billion, and the cost of 36 shuttle flights to build the station, estimated at $1.4 billion each, or $50.4 billion in total. Assuming 20,000 man-days of use from 2000 to 2015 by two- to six-person crews, each man-day would cost $7.5 million, less than half the inflation-adjusted $19.6 million ($5.5 million before inflation) per man-day ofSkylab. The ISS has become an international symbol of human capabilities, particularly human cooperation and science,defining a cooperative international approach and period, instead of a loomingcommercializedandmilitarizedinterplanetary world. Beside numerous documentaries such as the IMAX documentariesSpace Station 3Dfrom 2002,orA Beautiful Planetfrom 2016,and films likeApogee of Fear(2012)andYolki 5(2016)the ISS is the subject of feature films such asThe Day After Tomorrow(2004),Love(2011),together with the Chinese stationTiangong 1inGravity(2013),Life(2017),andI.S.S.(2023). In 2022, the movieThe Challenge(Doctor's House Call)was filmed aboard the ISS, and was notable for being the first feature film in which both professional actors and director worked together in space. The 2023 novel by English writerSamantha Harvey,Orbital, is set in the space station. It won the2024 Booker Prize Ceridwen Dovey'sOnly the Astronauts, a 2024 collection of short stories in which the narrator in each story is an inanimate object in space, includes the International Space Station. The ISS is blown up during theCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 2mission \"Second Sun\", in which the character Captain Price launches anICBMinto the earth's atmosphere; the resulting shockwave destroys the station. The ISS is present inFar Cry New Dawnas an expedition site, having fallen to earth during anuclear war.

            "Space Exploration Technologies Corp., commonly referred to asSpaceX, is an Americanspace technologycompany headquartered at theStarbase development siteinStarbase, Texas.Since its founding in 2002, the company has made numerous advances inrocket propulsion,reusable launch vehicles,human spaceflightandsatellite constellationtechnology. As of 2025[update], SpaceX is the world's dominantspace launchprovider, its launch cadence eclipsing all others, including private competitors and national programs like theChinese space program.SpaceX,NASA, and theUnited States Armed Forceswork closely together by means ofgovernmental contracts. SpaceX was founded byElon Muskin 2002 with a vision of decreasing the costs of space launches, paving the way toa self-sustaining colony on Mars. In 2008,Falcon 1successfully launched into orbit after three failed launch attempts. The company then moved towards the development of the largerFalcon 9rocket and theDragon 1capsule to satisfy NASA'sCOTS contractsfor deliveries to theInternational Space Station. By 2012, SpaceX finished all COTS test flights and began deliveringCommercial Resupply Servicesmissions to the International Space Station. Also around that time, SpaceX started developing hardware to make theFalcon 9 first stage reusable. The company demonstrated thefirst successful first-stage landing in 2015andre-launch of the first stage in 2017.Falcon Heavy, built from three Falcon 9 boosters,first flew in 2018after a more than decade-long development process. As of May 2025, the company's Falcon 9 rockets have landed and flown againmore than 450 times, reaching 1–3 launches a week. These milestones delivered the company much-needed investment and SpaceX sought todiversifyits sources of income. In 2019, the first operational satellite of theStarlinkinternetsatellite constellationcame online. In subsequent years, Starlink generated the bulk of SpaceX's income and paved the way for itsStarshieldmilitary counterpart. In 2020, SpaceX began to operate itsDragon 2capsules to deliver crewed missions for NASA and private entities. Around this time, SpaceX began building test prototypes forStarship, which is the largest launch vehicle in history and aims to fully realize the company's vision of a fully reusable, cost-effective and adaptable launch vehicle. SpaceX is also developing its ownspace suitandastronautvia itsPolaris programas well as developing thehuman lander for lunar missionsunder NASA'sArtemis program.SpaceX is not publicly traded; a space industry newspaper estimated that SpaceX has a revenue of over$10 billionin 2024. In early 2001,Elon MuskmetRobert Zubrinand donated$100,000to hisMars Society, joining its board of directors for a short time.: 30–31He gave aplenary talkat their fourth convention where he announcedMars Oasis, a project to land agreenhouseand grow plants on Mars.Musk initially attempted to acquire aDneprlaunch vehicle for the project through Russian contacts fromJim Cantrell. Musk returned with his team to Moscow, this time bringingMichael Griffin, who later became the 11thAdministrator of NASA, but found the Russians increasingly unreceptive.On the flight home, Musk announced he could start a company to build the affordable rockets they needed instead.By applyingvertical integration,using inexpensivecommercial off-the-shelfcomponents when possible,and adopting themodular approachof modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch costs. In early 2002, Elon Musk started to look for staff for his company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached five people for the initial positions at the fledgling company, including Griffin, who declined the position of Chief Engineer,: 11Jim Cantrelland John Garvey (Cantrell and Garvey later founded the companyVector Launch), rocket engineerTom Mueller, and Chris Thompson.SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse inEl Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees, such asTom Mueller(CTO),Gwynne Shotwell(COO), and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations), came from neighboringTRWandBoeingcorporations. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX's early employees.: 22 Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access tospace, ultimately by a factor of ten. SpaceX developed its firstorbital launch vehicle, theFalcon 1, with internal funding.The Falcon 1 was anexpendabletwo-stage-to-orbitsmall-lift launch vehicle. The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately$90 millionto$100 million.: 215 The Falcon rocket series was named afterStar Wars'sMillennium Falconfictional spacecraft. In 2004, SpaceX protested against NASA to theGovernment Accountability Office(GAO) because of a sole-source contract awarded toKistler Aerospace. Before the GAO could respond, NASA withdrew the contract, and formed theCOTS program.: 109–110In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space program through the end of the decade, a program that would later become theDragon spacecraft.In 2006, the company was selected by NASA and awarded$396 millionto provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts to the International Space Station (ISS) under theCOTS program. The first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by theUnited States Department of Defenseunder theDARPA Falcon Projectwhich evaluated new U.S. launch vehicles suitable for use in hypersonic missile delivery forPrompt Global Strike.The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and 2008, all resulted in failures, which almost ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed, as well,and consequentlyTesla,SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same time.: 178–182Musk was reportedly \"waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain\" because of the stress.: 216 The financial situation started to turn around with the first successful launch achieved onthe fourth attempton September 28, 2008. Musk split his remaining$30 millionbetween SpaceX and Tesla, and NASA awarded the firstCommercial Resupply Services(CRS) contract awarding$1.6 billionto SpaceX in December, thus financially saving the company.: 217–221Based on these factors and the further business operations they enabled, the Falcon 1 was soon retired following itssecond successful, and fifth total, launchin July 2009. This allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a larger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.Gwynne Shotwellwas also promoted to company president at the time, for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract with theNASAAssociate AdministratorBill Gerstenmaier.: 222 SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, theFalcon 5.The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of theFalcon 9, areusableheavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated byNASA, which committed to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from theCommercial Orbital Transportation Services(COTS) program in 2006.The overall contract award was$278 millionto provide development funding for theDragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon.As part of this contract, the Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with theDragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft. The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboardCOTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9's second flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits, completing all its mission objectives.By December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months. In April 2011, as part of its second-roundCommercial Crew Development(CCDev) program, NASA issued a$75 millioncontract for SpaceX to develop an integratedlaunch escape systemfor Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.NASA awarded SpaceX a fixed-priceSpace Act Agreement(SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in August 2012. In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was owned by Muskand his seventy million shares were then estimated to be worth$875 milliononprivate markets,valuing SpaceX at$1.3 billion.In May 2012, with theDragon C2+launch, Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to theInternational Space Station.After the flight, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to$2.4 billionor$20/share.By that time, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately$1 billionover its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity provided approximately$200 million, with Musk investing approximately$100 millionand other investors having put in about$100 million. SpaceX's active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects of the landing technology.TheFalcon 9 prototypesperformed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL). High-velocity, high-altitude tests of theboosteratmospheric return technology began in late 2013. SpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide.That yearArianespacerequested that European governments provide additionalsubsidiesto face the competition from SpaceX.Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S. military payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S. launch providerUnited Launch Alliance(ULA).The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise to over$400 millionover the years.In September 2014, NASA's Director of Commercial Spaceflight, Kevin Crigler, awarded SpaceX the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to finalize the development of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several technical and certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after certification. In January 2015, SpaceX raised$1 billionin funding fromGoogleandFidelity Investments, in exchange for 8.33% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately$12 billion.The same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite constellation, calledStarlink, to provide global broadband internet service with 4,000 satellites. The Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the seventh ISS resupply mission,CRS-7exploded two minutes into the flight. The problem was traced to a failed two-foot-long steel strut that held aheliumpressure vessel, which broke free due to the force ofacceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressurepropellant tank, causing the failure. SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015 withFalcon 9 Flight 20.In April 2016, the company achieved the first successful landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS)Of Course I Still Love Youin the Atlantic Ocean.By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage. A second major rocket failure happened in early September 2016, when a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill operation for a standard pre-launchstatic fire test. The payload, theAMOS-6communications satellite valued at$200 million, was destroyed.The explosion was caused by theliquid oxygenthat is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and ignited withcarbon compositehelium vessels.Though not considered an unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017. In March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for theSES-10satellite. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.The first stage was recovered again, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket. In July 2017, the company raised$350 million, which raised its valuation to$21 billion.In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts.By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about$12 billionin contract revenue.The contracts included both commercial andgovernment(NASA/DOD) customers.This made SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches. In 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary,The Boring Company,and began work to construct a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, using a small number of SpaceX employees,which was completed in May 2018,and opened to the public in December 2018.During 2018, The Boring Company wasspun outinto a separatecorporate entitywith 6% of the equity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk. In 2019 SpaceX raised$1.33 billionof capital across three funding rounds.By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to$33.3 billionand reached$36 billionby March 2020. On August 19, 2020, after a$1.9 billionfunding round, one of the largest single fundraising pushes by any privately held company, SpaceX's valuation increased to$46 billion. In February 2021, SpaceX raised an additional$1.61 billionin an equity round from 99 investorsat a per share value of approximately$420,raising the company valuation to approximately$74 billion. By 2021, SpaceX had raised more than$6 billionin equity financing. Most of the capital raised since 2019 has been used to support the operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the development and manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle.By October 2021, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to$100.3 billion.On April 16, 2021, Starship HLS won a contract to play a critical role in the NASA crewed spaceflightArtemis program.By 2021, SpaceX had entered into agreements withGoogle Cloud PlatformandMicrosoft Azureto provide on-ground computer and networking services forStarlink.A new round of financing in 2022 valued SpaceX at$127 billion. In July 2021, SpaceX unveiled another drone ship namedA Shortfall of Gravitas, landing a booster fromCRS-23on it for the first time on August 29, 2021.Within the first 130 days of 2022, SpaceX had 18 rocket launches and two astronaut splashdowns. On December 13, 2021, company CEOElon Muskannounced that the company was starting acarbon dioxide removalprogram that wouldconvert captured carbonintorocket fuel,after he announced a$100 milliondonation to theX Prize Foundationthe previous February to provide the monetary rewards to winners in a contest to develop the bestcarbon capture technology. In August 2022,Reutersreported that theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) began initial discussions with SpaceX that could lead to the company's launchers being used temporarily, given that Russia blocked access toSoyuzrockets amid theRussian invasion of Ukraine.Since that invasion and in the greater war between Russia and Ukraine, Starlinkwas extensively used. In 2022, SpaceX's Falcon 9 also became the world record holder for the most launches of a single vehicle type in a single year.[non-primary source needed]SpaceX launched a rocket approximately every six days in 2022, with 61 launches in total. All but one (a Falcon Heavy in November) was on a Falcon 9 rocket. In November 2023, SpaceX announced it would acquire its parachute supplierPioneer Aerospaceout of bankruptcy for$2.2 million. On July 16, 2024, Elon Musk posted onXthat SpaceX would move its headquarters fromHawthorne, California, toSpaceX StarbaseinBrownsville, Texas. Musk said this was because the recently passed CaliforniaAB1955 bill\"and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies\".This new law in California bans school districts from requiring that teachers notify parents about changes to a student's sexual orientation and gender identity.The headquarters officially moved toBrownsville, Texasin August 2024, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State.The move to relocate SpaceX's headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term. The Hawthorne facility continues to support the company's Falcon launch vehicles, which was SpaceX's workhorse product in 2024. SpaceX's 2024Polaris Dawnmission featured the first-ever private spacewalk, marking a major milestone in commercial space exploration. In 2025,ProPublicareported that Chinese investors were investing in SpaceX via offshore entities, such as theCayman Islands. Experts speculated that this might raise national security concerns with regulators.Later in 2025 ProPublica reported that Chinese equity ownership in SpaceX likely extended to direct investment, citing the court testimony of investor Iqbaljit Kahlon. By July 2025, as part of $5 Billion equity raise SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion inxAI. In January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance theStarshipandStarlinkprojects.The purpose of the Starship vehicle is to enable large-scale transit of humans and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.SpaceX's Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, with a planned payload capacity of 100+ tons.Construction of initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing moved to the newSpaceX South Texas launch sitelater that year. On April 20, 2023, Starship'sfirst orbital flight testended in a mid-air explosion over theGulf of Mexicobefore booster separation. After launch, multiple engines in the booster progressively failed, causing the vehicle to reachmaxqlater than planned. \"Max q\" is the theoretical point of maximal mechanical stress which occurs during the launch sequence of a space vehicle. In the case of a rocket that must be self-destructed during its ascent, max q occurs at the point of self-destruction. Eventually, the vehicle lost control and spun erratically until the automatedflight termination systemwas activated, which intentionally destroyed the rocket. Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other individuals familiar with the space industry have referred to the test flight as a success. Musk said at the time that it would take \"six to eight weeks\" to get the infrastructure prepared for another launch. In October 2023, a senior SpaceX executive stated the company had been ready to launch the next test flight since September. He accused government regulators of disrupting the project's progress, adding the delay could lead to China beating U.S. astronauts back to the Moon. On November 18, 2023, SpaceX launched Starship on itssecond flight test, with both vehicles flying for a few minutes before separately exploding. In early March 2024 SpaceX announced that it was targeting March 14 as the tentative launch date for its next uncrewed Starship launch configuration flight test, pending the issuance of a \"launch license\" by theFAA. This license was granted on March 13, 2024.On March 14, 2024, at 13:25 UTC,Starship launched for the third timeand for the first time Starship reached its planned suborbital trajectory. The flight ended with the booster experiencing a malfunction shortly before landing and the ship being lost during re-entry over the Indian Ocean. On June 4, 2024, SpaceX received the launch license forStarship's fourth flight test. The licensure itself was notable in that it was the first time that the FAA included a clause that would allow SpaceX to launch subsequent test flights without a mishap investigation, provided that they met a similar launch profile and used the same specification of hardware. The provision could prove to speed the development timeline. On October 12, 2024, SpaceX received FAA approval forStarship's fifth flight test.The flight was the first without engine failures, and the first successful tower catch. SpaceX launched Starship on itssixth flight teston November 19, 2024.The booster aborted the catch attempt, while the ship conducted a relight in space. On January 16, 2025, SpaceX launched Starship on itsseventh flight test, with the first Block 2 Ship, Ship 33 (standing at 403 ft or 123 meters). This test also carried a demonstration payload, a Starlink V3 simulator. The test launched at 22:37 UTC. The test resulted in the second catch of the Super Heavy booster, B14, but  after 8 minutes, SpaceX lost contact with 'Ship', which is the upper stage of the Starship which resulted in the failure of the ship during the ascent. The spacecraft reportedly exploded around 8.5 minutes after launch over the Atlantic Ocean near theTurks and Caicos Islands. The FAA, on January 18, required a mishap investigation of the failure. On March 7, 2025, SpaceX launched another Starship rocket, this time from Texas. Contact was lost minutes into the test flight and the spacecraft came tumbling down and broke apart, with wreckage seen across Florida's skies.As per preliminary investigation, Starship’s 7th test flight was disrupted by an oxygen leak, flashes and sustained fires in its aft section, which caused the rocket’s engines to shut down and turn on the spacecraft’s self-destruct system. On June 18, 2025, a SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during a static fire test at the company’s Starbase facility in Texas, following what the company described as a “major anomaly”. A significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug HurleyandBob Behnken) into orbit on aCrew Dragonspacecraft duringCrew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch from American soil in 9 years.The mission launched fromKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A(LC-39A) in Florida. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first large batch of 60 Starlink satellites, beginning to deploy what would become the world's largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.In 2022, most SpaceX launches focused on Starlink, a consumer internet business that sends batches of internet-beaming satellites and now has over 6,000 satellites in orbit. On July 16, 2021, SpaceX entered an agreement to acquireSwarm Technologies, a private company building alow Earth orbitsatellite constellation for communications withInternet of things(IoT) devices, for$524 million. In December 2022, the U.S.Federal Communications Commission(FCC) approved the launch of up to 7,500 of SpaceX's next-generation satellites in its Starlink internet network. In September 2025, SpaceX said it would purchase the rights to use some ofEchoStar's spectrum for $17 billion in a cash and stock deal. The company said it would use the spectrum as a foundation for Starlink's direct-to-cell business around the globe. SpaceX has developed three launch vehicles. The small-liftFalcon 1was the first launch vehicle developed and was retired in 2009. The medium-liftFalcon 9and the heavy-liftFalcon Heavyare both operational. Falcon 1was a small rocket capable of placing several hundred kilograms intolow Earth orbit. It launched five times between 2006 and 2009, of which two were successful.The Falcon 1 was the first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit. Falcon 9is amedium-lift launch vehiclecapable of delivering up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265lb) to orbit, competing with theDelta IVand theAtlas Vrockets, as well as other launch providers around the world. It has nineMerlinengines in its first stage. TheFalcon 9 v1.0rocket successfully reached orbit on its first attempt on June 4, 2010. Its third flight,COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on May 22, 2012, and launched the firstcommercialspacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).The vehicle was upgraded toFalcon 9 v1.1in 2013,Falcon 9 Full Thrustin 2015, and finally toFalcon 9 Block 5in 2018. The first stage of Falcon 9 is designed to retro propulsively land, be recovered, and flown again. Falcon Heavyis aheavy-lift launch vehiclecapable of delivering up to 63,800kg (140,700lb) toLow Earth orbit(LEO) or 26,700kg (58,900lb) togeosynchronous transfer orbit(GTO). It uses three slightly modified Falcon 9 first-stage cores with a total of 27Merlin 1Dengines.The Falcon Heavy successfully flew its inaugural mission on February 6, 2018, launching Musk's personalTesla Roadsterintoheliocentric orbit. Both the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are certified to conduct launches for theNational Security Space Launch(NSSL).As of October 28, 2025, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been launched 565 times, resulting in 562 full mission successes, one partial success, andone in-flight failure. In addition, a Falcon 9 experienceda pre-flight failurebefore a static fire test in 2016. SpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known asStarship. It comprises a reusable first stage, calledSuper Heavy, and the reusableStarship second stagespace vehicle. As of 2017[update], the system was intended to supersede the company's existing launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s. Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed severalrocket engines–Merlin,Kestrel, andRaptor– for use inlaunch vehicles,Dracofor thereaction control systemof the Dragon series of spacecraft,andSuperDracofor abort capability inCrew Dragon. Merlin is a family of rocket engines that usesliquid oxygen(LOX) andRP-1propellants. Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1's first stage and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.Kestrel uses the same propellants and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second-stage main engine. Draco andSuperDracoarehypergolicliquid-propellant rocket engines. Draco engines are used on thereaction control systemof theDragonandDragon 2spacecraft.TheSuperDracoengine is more powerful, and eight SuperDraco engines providelaunch escape capabilityfor crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft during an abort scenario. Raptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquidmethane-fueledfull-flow staged combustion cycleengines to power the first and second stages of the in-developmentStarshiplaunch system.Development versions were test-fired in late 2016,and the engine flew for the first time in 2019, powering theStarhoppervehicle to an altitude of 20 m (66 ft). SpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space Station (ISS). The first-generationDragon 1spacecraft was used only for cargo operations. It was developed with financial support from NASA under theCommercial Orbital Transportation Services(COTS) program. After a successful COTS demonstration flight in 2010, SpaceX was chosen to receive aCommercial Resupply Services(CRS) contract. The currently operational second-generationDragon 2spacecraft conductedits first flight, without crew, to the ISS in early 2019, followed bya crewed flightof Dragon 2 in 2020.It was developed with financial support from NASA under theCommercial Crew Programprogram. Thecargo variant of Dragon 2flew for the first time in December 2020, for a resupply to the ISS as part of the CRS contract with NASA. In March 2020 SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL, designed as a resupply spacecraft for NASA's plannedLunar Gatewayspace station under aGateway Logistics Services(GLS) contract.Dragon XL is planned to launch on theFalcon Heavy, and is able to transport over 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) to the Gateway. Dragon XL will be docked at the Gateway for six to twelve months at a time. SpaceX designed a spacesuitto be worn inside the Dragon spacecraft to protect from possible depressurization.On May 4, 2024, SpaceX unveiled a second spacesuit designed forextravehicular activity, planned to be used for aspacewalkduring thePolaris Dawnmission. SpaceX routinely returns thefirst stageof Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches. The rocket lands at a predetermined landing site using only its propulsion systems.When propellant margins do not permit a return to a launch site (RTLS), rockets return to a floating landing platform in the ocean, calledautonomous spaceport drone ships(ASDS). SpaceX also had plans to introducefloating launch platforms, which would be modified oil rigs provide a sea launch option for theirStarshiplaunch vehicle. As of February 2023, SpaceX had sold the oil rigs, but had not ruled out sea-based platforms for future use. Starlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of SpaceX,that consists of thousands of cross-linkedcommunications satellitesin ~550km orbits. Its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband capabilities.Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on the SpaceXPaz satellitemission in 2017. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites aboard a Falcon 9.Initial test operation of the constellation began in late 2020and first orders were taken in early 2021.Customers were told to expect internet service speeds of 50 Mbit/s to 150 Mbit/s and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms.In December 2022, Starlink reached over 1 million subscribers worldwide. The planned large number ofStarlinksatellites has been criticized by astronomers due to concerns overlight pollution,with the brightness of Starlink satellites in both optical and radio wavelengths interfering with scientific observations.In response, SpaceX has implemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness.The large number of satellites employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers ofspace debris collisions.However, the satellites are equipped withkrypton-fueledHall thrusterswhich allow them tode-orbitat the end of their life. They are also designed to autonomously avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data. In December 2022, SpaceX announcedStarshield, a program to incorporate military or government entity payloads on board a Starlink-derived satellite bus. TheSpace Development Agencyis a key customer procuring satellites for a space-basedmissile defensesystem. In June 2024, SpaceX introduced a compact version of its Starlink antennas, the \"Starlink Mini\", designed for mobile satellite internet use. Offered for$599in an early access release, it was more expensive than the base model. The Mini antenna, half the size and one-third the weight of the Standard version, featured a built-inWiFi router, lower power consumption, and over 100 Mbit/s download speeds. In June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would sponsor aHyperloop competition, and would build a 1.6 km (0.99 mi) longsubscaletest track near SpaceX's headquarters for the competitive events.The company held the annual competition from 2017 to 2019. In collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in the creation of aCOVID-19antibody-testing program in 2020. As such, 4300 employees volunteered to provide blood samples resulting in apeer-reviewedscientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection against the virus. In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build amini-submarineto assist therescue of children stuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand.Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".Engineers at SpaceX andThe Boring Companybuilt the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9liquid oxygentransfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn't practical for the rescue mission. SpaceX is headquartered at theSpaceX StarbasenearBrownsville, Texas, where it manufactures and launches its Starship vehicle. However most of the company's operations are based out of its office inHawthorne, Californiawhere it was previously headquartered, where it builds Falcon rockets and Dragon spacecraft, and where it houses its mission control. The company also operates a Starlink satellite manufacturing facilities in Redmond, Washington, arocket development and test facilityinMcGregor, Texas,and maintains an office in the Washington, D.C. area, close to key government customers. SpaceX has two active launch sites in Florida, one active launch site in California and one active launch site at Starbase in Texas. SpaceX operates a large facility in the Los Angeles suburb ofHawthorne, California. The three-story building, originally built byNorthrop Corporationto buildBoeing 747fuselages,houses SpaceX's office space, mission control, and Falcon 9 manufacturing facilities. The area has one of the largest concentrations of space sector headquarters, facilities, and subsidiaries in the U.S., includingBoeing/McDonnell Douglasmain satellite building campuses,The Aerospace Corporation,Raytheon, NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory,United States Space Force'sSpace Systems CommandatLos Angeles Air Force Base,Lockheed Martin,BAE Systems,Northrop Grumman, andAECOM, etc., with a large pool of aerospace engineers and recent college engineering graduates. SpaceX uses a high degree ofvertical integrationin the production of its rockets and rocket engines.SpaceX builds itsrocket engines,rocket stages,spacecraft, principalavionicsand allsoftwarein-house in their Hawthorne facility, which is unusual for the space industry. The Hawthorne facility was SpaceX's headquarters until August 2024. However, the move to relocate SpaceX's headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term, as the facility will remain to the company's operations. SpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from theSpaceX StarbaseinBoca ChicanearBrownsville, Texas, having announced first plans for the launch facility in August 2014.TheFederal Aviation Administration(FAA) issued the permit in July 2014.SpaceX broke ground on the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up in the latter half of 2015,with the firstsuborbitallaunches from the facility in 2019and orbital launches starting in 2023. SpaceX has faced increased scrutiny over the environmental impact of its Starbase facility.In August 2024, theTexas Commission on Environmental Qualitycited SpaceX for violating environmental regulations by repeatedly releasing pollutants into water near the Boca Chica launch site.TheEPAfined SpaceX approximately$150,000for allegedly discharging \"industrial wastewater\" and violating theClean Water Act. SpaceX's Rocket Development and Test Facility inMcGregor, Texasis arocket engine test facility. Every rocket engine and thruster manufactured by SpaceX must pass through McGregor for final testing being used on flight missions.The facility also serves as a testing ground for various components and engines during theresearch and developmentprocess.In addition to engine testing, after splashdown and recovery,Dragon spacecraftmake a stop at McGregor to have their hazardoushypergolic propellantfuels removed, before the capsules continue on to Hawthorne for refurbishment. SpaceX calls the facility the most advanced and active rocket engine test facility in the world, and said that as of 2024[update], over 7,000 tests had been conducted at the facility since it opened, with seven engine test fires on a typical day, across more than a dozen test stands.Despite its low-profile compared to the company's other facilities, is a critical part of SpaceX's operations, and company president and COOGwynne Shotwellmaintains her primary office in McGregor. Originally the site of theBluebonnet Ordnance Plantduring World War II,the facility was later used byBeal Aerospacebefore being leased by SpaceX in 2003.The company has since expanded it significantly from 256 acres (104 ha) in 2003to 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) by 2015.In July 2021, SpaceX announced plans to build a second production facility for Raptor engines at McGregor. This expansion is expected to significantly increase SpaceX's production capacity, with the goal of producing 800 to 1,000 Raptor engines per year. SpaceX'sStarlinksubsidiary operates over two main facilities. Satellite manufacturing takes place nearSeattle, Washington while user terminal manufacturing takes place nearAustin, Texas. Starlink's satellite development and manufacturing operations campus occupies over 314,000 square feet (29,200 m2) in at least six buildings located inRedmond, Washington, east of Seattle. The first building opened in early 2015,and the company later expanded into five buildings on the Redmond Ridge Corporate Center. Starlink opened a user terminal manufacturing facility just outside ofBastrop, Texas, east of Austin in December 2023. In its first nine months of operation, the one-million-square-foot (93,000 m2) facility produced one million user terminals and was on track to become the largest factory forprinted circuit boardsin the United States. SpaceX operates fourorbitallaunch sites, atCape Canaveral Space Force StationandKennedy Space Centerin Florida andVandenberg Space Force Basein California for Falcon rockets, andStarbasenearBrownsville, Texasfor Starship. SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad.The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral and Kennedy enable orbits of medium inclination (28.5–55°).Larger inclinations, includingSSO, are possible from Florida by overflying Cuba. Before it was retired, allFalcon 1launches took place at theRonald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test SiteonOmelek Islandof theMarshall Islands. In April 2007,the Pentagonapproved the use ofCape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40(SLC-40) by SpaceX.The site has been used since 2010 for Falcon 9 launches, mainly to low Earth and geostationary orbits. The formerLaunch Complex 13at Cape Canaveral, now renamedLanding Zones 1 and 2, has since 2015 been used for Falcon 9first-stage booster landings.Later on, SpaceX will retire these two landing zones and add threelanding zonesforFalcon 9andFalcon Heavyrockets to conduct to \"Return-to-launch-site\" landings, two at LC-39A and one at SLC-40. Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 4(SLC-4E) was leased from the military in 2011 and is used for payloads to polar orbits. The Vandenberg site can launch both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles,but cannot launch to low inclination orbits. The neighboring SLC-4W was converted toLanding Zone 4in 2015 for booster landings. On April 14, 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease forKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A.The pad was subsequently modified to supportFalcon 9andFalcon Heavylaunches. As of 2024[update]it is the only pad that supports Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX launched itsfirst crewed missionto the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on May 30, 2020.Pad 39A has been prepared since 2019 to eventually accommodate Starship launches. With delays in launch FAA permits for Boca Chica, Texas, the 39A Starship preparation was accelerated in 2022. SpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts fromNASAfor the International Space Station (ISS) with technology the company developed. SpaceX is also certified forU.S. militarylaunches ofEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads. With approximately thirty missions on the manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represented over$12 billionunder contract. In 2006, SpaceX won a NASACommercial Orbital Transportation Services(COTS) Phase 1 contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to the ISS, with a possible contract option for crew transport.Through this contract, designed by NASA to provide \"seed money\" through Space Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid SpaceX$396 millionto develop the cargo configuration of the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9 launch vehicle with their resources.TheseSpace Act Agreementshave been shown to have saved NASA millions of dollars in development costs, making rocket development 4–10 times less expensive than if produced by NASA alone. In December 2010, with the launch of theSpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1mission, SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft.Dragon successfully berthed with the ISS duringSpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2in May 2012, a first for aprivate spacecraft. Commercial Resupply Services(CRS) is a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for the delivery of cargo and supplies to the ISS on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded$1.6 billionto SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016.SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed, and remained on station for 20 days, beforere-entering the atmosphereand splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX, and then extended the contract further for a total of twenty cargo missions to the ISS.The final Dragon 1 mission,SpaceX CRS-20, departed the ISS in April 2020, andDragonwas subsequently retired from service. Asecond phaseof contracts was awarded in January 2016 with SpaceX as one of the awardees. SpaceX will fly up to nine additional CRS flights with the upgradedDragon 2spacecraft.In March 2020, NASA contracted SpaceX to develop theDragon XLspacecraft to send supplies to theLunar Gatewayspace station. Dragon XL will be launched on a Falcon Heavy. SpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA astronauts to and from the ISS. The NASA contracts started as part of the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially operated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to the ISS. The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in 2011,followed by another in 2012 to continue development and testing of itsDragon 2spacecraft. In September 2014, NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing as the two companies that would be funded to develop systems to transport U.S. crews to and from the ISS.SpaceX won$2.6 billionto complete and certify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts called for at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA astronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon received NASA human-spaceflight certification, the contract required SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station. SpaceX completed the first key flight test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, aPad Abort Test, in May 2015,and successfully conducted a full uncrewed test flight in early 2019. The capsule docked to the ISS and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.In January 2020, SpaceX conducted anin-flight abort test, the last test flight before flying crew, in which the Dragon spacecraft fired its launch escape engines in a simulated abort scenario. On May 30, 2020, theCrew Dragon Demo-2mission was launched to theInternational Space Stationwith NASA astronautsBob BehnkenandDoug Hurley, the first time a crewed vehicle had launched from the U.S. since 2011, and the first SpaceX commercial crewed launch to the ISS.TheCrew-1mission was successfully launched to the International Space Station on November 16, 2020, withNASAastronautsMichael Hopkins,Victor GloverandShannon Walkeralong withJAXAastronautSoichi Noguchi,all members of theExpedition 64crew.On April 23, 2021,Crew-2was launched to the International Space Station with NASA astronautsShane KimbroughandK. Megan McArthur, JAXA astronautAkihiko Hoshide, andESAastronautThomas Pesquet.The Crew-2 mission successfully docked on April 24, 2021. SpaceX also offers paidcrewed spaceflightsfor private individuals. The first of these missions,Inspiration4, launched in 2021 on behalf ofShift4 PaymentsCEOJared Isaacman. The mission launched theCrew DragonResiliencefrom the FloridaKennedy Space Center'sLaunch Complex 39Aatop aFalcon 9launch vehicle, placed the Dragoncapsuleintolow Earth orbit, and ended successfully about three days later when theResiliencesplashed down in the Atlantic Ocean. All four crew members received commercial astronaut training from SpaceX. The training included lessons in orbital mechanics, operating in a microgravity environment, stress testing, emergency-preparedness training, and mission simulations. In 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded anIndefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity(IDIQ) contract, allowing theUnited States Air Forceto purchase up to$100 millionworth of launches from the company.Three years later,NASAannounced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract to SpaceX for up to$1 billion, depending on the number of missions awarded.In December 2012, SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with theUnited States Department of Defense(DoD). The United States Air ForceSpace and Missile Systems Centerawarded SpaceX two EELV-class missions:Deep Space Climate Observatory(DSCOVR) andSpace Test Program 2(STP-2). DSCOVR was launched on aFalcon 9launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on aFalcon Heavyon June 25, 2019. TheFalcon 9 v1.1was certified forNational Security Space Launch(NSSL) in 2015, allowing SpaceX to contract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security.This broke the monopoly held since 2006 byUnited Launch Alliance(ULA) over U.S. Air Force launches of classified payloads.In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch to SpaceX to launch the secondGPS IIIsatellite for$82.7 million.This was approximately 40% less than the estimated cost for similar previous missions.SpaceX also launched the third GPS III launch on June 20, 2020.In March 2018, SpaceX secured an additional$290 millioncontract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three GPS III satellites. The U.S.National Reconnaissance Office(NRO) also purchased launches from SpaceX, with the first taking place on May 1, 2017.In February 2019, SpaceX secured a$297 millioncontract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three national security missions, all slated to launch no earlier than FY 2021.In August 2020, theU.S. Space Forceawarded its National Security Space Launch (NSSL) contracts for the following 5–7 years. SpaceX won a contract for$316 millionfor one launch. In addition, SpaceX will handle 40% of the U.S. military's satellite launch requirements over the period. SpaceX also designs and launchescustom military satellitesfor theSpace Development Agencyas part of a new missile defense system in low Earth orbit.The constellation would give the United States capabilities to sense, target and potentially intercept nuclear missiles and hypersonic weapons launched from anywhere on Earth.Both China and Russia brought concerns to the United Nations about the program,and various organizations warn it could be destabilizing and trigger anarms racein space. In March 2024, Reuters reported that, as part of a$1.8 billioncontract signed with the National Reconnaissance Office in 2021, SpaceX is building a network of hundreds ofspy satellites. This new network, Reuters reported, would be able to operate as a swarm in low orbits. In December 2024, WSJ reported that Musk didn't have access to government secrets. SpaceX's low launch prices, especially forcommunications satellitesflying togeostationary transfer orbit(GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices.Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying theAriane 5) andInternational Launch Services(flying theProton).With a published price of$56.5 millionper launch tolow Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the least expensive in the industry.European satellite operators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of theAriane 5andAriane 6rockets as a result of competition from SpaceX. SpaceX ended the United Launch Alliance (ULA) monopoly of U.S. military payloads when it began to compete for national security launches. In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders.To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half. Congressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASASpace Act Agreementprocess of \"setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry\" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially lower cost. According to NASA's own independently verified numbers, SpaceX's total development cost for the Falcon 9 rocket, including the Falcon 1 rocket, was estimated at$390 million. In 2011, NASA estimated that it would have cost the agency about$4 billionto develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA's traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.In May 2020, NASA administratorJim Bridenstineremarked that thanks to NASA's investments into SpaceX, the United States has 70% of the commercial launch market, a major improvement since 2012 when there were no commercial launches from the country. As of 2024, SpaceX operates a Rideshare and Bandwagon (mid inclination) programs. This provides additional competition for small satellite launchers. In November 2022, the company announced COO Gwynne Shotwell and vice presidentMark Juncosawould oversee Starbase, its Texas launch facility, along with Omead Afshar, who at the time oversaw operations for Tesla in Texas. Shyamal Patel, who was senior director of operations at the site, would shift to its Cape Canaveral site.CNBCreported that these executive moves demonstrated \"the sense of urgency within the company to get Starship flying\". According to The New York Times, SpaceX has likely paid little to no federal income taxes due totax loss deferralof up to $5.4bn in deferred losses, but has privately told investors that it may never realize some or all of those losses. According to former NASA deputy administratorLori Garver, the company overall has a male-dominated employee culture,  similar to that of the spaceflight industry in general.In December 2021, claims of workplace sexual harassment from five former SpaceX employees, ranging from interns to full engineers, were published.The former employees claimed to have experienced unwanted advances and uncomfortable interactions.Additionally, the accounts included claims of a culture ofsexual harassmentexisting at the company and one where complaints made to executives, managers, and human resources officers went largely unaddressed. In May 2022, a Business Insider article alleged that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct with a SpaceX flight attendant in a private jet in 2016 citing an anonymous friend of the flight attendant.In response, some employees collaborated on an open letter condemning \"Elon's harmful Twitter behavior\".It also asks the company to clearly define SpaceX's \"no-asshole\" and \"zero tolerance\" policies, which it says is unequally enforced from one employee to the next. The next day, Gwynne Shotwell announced that those employees who were involved with the letter had been terminated and claimed that unsponsored, unsolicited surveys were sent to employees during the work day and that some felt pressured to sign the letter. The company has also been described as having a work culture that pushes employees to work excessively and is described as fostering aburnoutculture.According to a memo byBlue Origin, a rival aerospace company with a history of lawsuits and anti-SpaceX political lobbying,SpaceX expected very long work hours, work on weekends, and limited use of holidays. \"SpaceX employees say they’re paying the price for the billionaire’s push to colonize space at breakneck speed\" reported Reuters in 2023. An examination of OSHA's records revealed injury rates higher than the industry's averages. In addition, Reuters documented at least 600 previously unreported workplace injuries at SpaceX, including \"crushed limbs, amputations, electrocutions, head and eye wounds and one death.\"The person who died was Lonnie LeBlanc, a former United States Marine. In June 2024, eight ex-employees, the same who had previously been fired for penning the open letter against Elon Musk, filed a lawsuit against Musk and SpaceX alleging sexual harassment and discrimination.The lawsuit has since stalled on headquarter jurisdiction grounds. In August 2023, theU.S. Department of Justice(DOJ) filed a lawsuit against SpaceX for discriminating againstrefugeesandasylum seekersin its hiring process, alleging that the company violated theImmigration and Nationality Actby rejecting refugees and asylum recipients and hiring only U.S. citizens andpermanent residents.SpaceX denied wrongdoing, citing U.S.export controllaw.In February 2025, the DOJ filed a motion to dismiss the casewith prejudice. In December 2024, federal agencies investigated SpaceX for security violations as well as Musk's alleged drug use. According to an investigation conducted by NPR, \"SpaceX has sometimes ignored environmental regulations as it rushed to fulfill its founder’s vision. With each of its launches, records show, the company discharged tens of thousands of gallons of what regulators classify as industrial wastewater into the surrounding environment.\"In addition to endangering nearby people, the wastewater poses significant threats to wildlife. The 2025 SpaceX Starship Flight 7 rocket explosion sent debris into the atmosphere that was spread across the Caribbean Sea. The incident also \"released significant amounts of harmful air pollution into the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere.\"\n",

            "Junois aNASAspace probe orbiting the planetJupiter. Built byLockheed Martinand operated by NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory, the spacecraft was launched fromCape Canaveral Air Force Stationon August 5, 2011UTC, as part of theNew Frontiers program.Junoentered apolar orbitof Jupiter on July 5, 2016, UTC,to begin a scientific investigation of the planet.After completing its mission,Junowas originally planned to be intentionally deorbited into Jupiter's atmosphere,but has since been approved to continue orbiting until contact is lost with the spacecraft,but it is scheduled to be shut down per the FY2026 budget proposed by the second Donald Trump administration.However, if Juno mission receives a third mission extension, it will continue to explore Jupiter for another three years to studyJovian ringsandinner moonsarea which is not well explored;this phase will also include close flybys of the moonsThebe,Amalthea,Adrastea, andMetis. Juno'smission is to measure Jupiter's composition,gravitational field,magnetic field, andpolar magnetosphere. It also searches for clues about how the planet formed, including whether it has a rocky core, the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere,mass distribution, and its deep winds, which can reach speeds up to 620 km/h (390 mph). Junois the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear poweredGalileoorbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all earlier spacecraft sent to theouter Solar Systemand beyond—which usedradioisotope thermoelectric generatorsfor power—Junois powered by solar panels, more commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in theinner Solar System.Accordingly,Junorequired the three largest solar panel wings ever deployed on a planetary probe (at the time of launching). These play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft as well as generating power. Juno'sname comes fromGreek and Roman mythology. The godJupiterdrew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief, and his wife, the goddessJuno, was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature. A NASA compilation of mission names and acronyms referred to the mission by thebackronymJupiter Near-polar Orbiter.However the project itself has consistently described it as a name with mythological associationsand not an acronym. The spacecraft's current name is in reference to the Roman goddessJuno.Junois sometimes called theNew Frontiers 2as the second mission in the New Frontiers program,but is not to be confused withNew Horizons 2, a proposed but unselected New Frontiers mission. Junowas selected on June 9, 2005, as the next New Frontiers mission afterNew Horizons.The desire for a Jupiter probe was strong in the years prior to this, but there had not been any approved missions.TheDiscovery Programhad passed over the somewhat similar but more limited Interior Structure and Internal Dynamical Evolution of Jupiter (INSIDE Jupiter) proposal,and the turn-of-the-century eraEuropa Orbiterwas canceled in 2002.The flagship-levelEuropa Jupiter System Missionwas in the works in the early 2000s, but funding issues resulted in it evolving into ESA'sJupiter Icy Moons Explorer. Junocompleted a five-year cruise to Jupiter, arriving on July 5, 2016.The spacecraft traveled a total distance of roughly 2.8×10^9km (19 AU; 1.7×10^9mi) to reach Jupiter.The spacecraft was designed to orbit Jupiter 37 times over the course of its mission. This was originally planned to take 20 months. Juno'strajectory used agravity assistspeed boost from Earth, accomplished by an Earth flyby in October 2013, two years after its launch on August 5, 2011.The spacecraft performed an orbit insertion burn to slow it enough to allow capture. It was expected to make three 53-day orbits before performing another burn on December 11, 2016, that would bring it into a 14-daypolar orbitcalled the Science Orbit. Because of a suspected problem inJuno'smain engine, the burn scheduled on December 11, 2016, was cancelled andJunoremained in its 53-day orbit until the firstGanymedeencounter of its Extended Mission.This extended mission began with a flyby of Ganymede on June 7, 2021.Subsequent flybys of Europa and thenIodecreased the orbital period to 33 days by February 2024. During the science mission,infraredandmicrowaveinstruments will measure the thermal radiation emanating from deep withinJupiter's atmosphere. These observations will complement previous studies of its composition by assessing the abundance and distribution of water, and therefore oxygen. This data will provide insight into Jupiter's origins.Junowill also investigate theconvectionthat drives natural circulation patterns in Jupiter's atmosphere. Other instruments aboardJunowill gather data about its gravitational field and polarmagnetosphere. TheJunomission was planned to conclude in February 2018 after completing 37 orbits of Jupiter, but now has been commissioned through 2025 to do a further 42 additional orbits of Jupiter as well as close flybys of Ganymede, Europa and Io.The probe was then intended to bedeorbitedand burnt up in Jupiter's outer atmosphereto avoid any possibility of impact and biological contamination of one of its moons. Junowas launched atop anAtlas V(551 configuration) atCape Canaveral Air Force Station(CCAFS),Floridaon August 5, 2011, 16:25:00 UTC. The Atlas V (AV-029) used a Russian-builtRD-180main engine, powered bykeroseneandliquid oxygen. The main engine ignited and underwent checkout then, 3.8 seconds later, the five strap-onsolid rocket boosters(SRBs) ignited. Following the SRB burnout, about 93 seconds into the flight, two of the spent boosters fell away from the vehicle, followed 1.5 seconds later by the remaining three. When heating levels had dropped below predetermined limits, thepayload fairingthat protectedJunoduring launch and transit through the thickest part of the atmosphere separated, about 3 minutes 24 seconds into the flight. The Atlas V main engine cut off 4 minutes 26 seconds after liftoff. Sixteen seconds later, theCentaur second stageignited, and it burned for about 6 minutes, putting the satellite into an initialparking orbit.The vehicle coasted for about 30 minutes, and then the Centaur was reignited for a second firing of 9 minutes, placing the spacecraft on anEarthescape trajectory in aheliocentric orbit. Prior to separation, the Centaur stage used onboardreaction enginesto spinJunoup to 1.4r.p.m.About 54 minutes after launch, the spacecraft separated from the Centaur and began to extend itssolar panels.Following the full deployment and locking of the solar panels,Juno'sbatteries began to recharge. Deployment of the solar panels reducedJuno'sspin rate by two-thirds. The probe is spun to ensure stability during the voyage and so that all instruments on the probe are able to observe Jupiter. The voyage to Jupiter took five years, and included two orbital maneuvers in August and September 2012 and aflyby of the Earthon October 9, 2013.When it reached theJovian system,Junohad traveled approximately 19 astronomical units (2.8 billion kilometres). After traveling for about a year in anellipticalheliocentric orbit,Junoperformed two deep space maneuvers (DSMs), firing its engine twice nearaphelion(beyond the orbit ofMars) to change its orbitand return to pass by theEarthat a distance of 559 kilometers in October 2013.The combination of the DSMs and the resulting Earth flybyhelped Juno slingshot itself toward the Jovian system in a maneuver called agravity assist.The spacecraft received a boost in speed of more than 3.9 km/s (8,700 mph), and it was set on a course to Jupiter.The flyby was also used as a rehearsal for theJunoscience team to test some instruments and practice certain procedures before the arrival at Jupiter. Jupiter's gravity accelerated the approaching spacecraft to around 210,000 km/h (130,000 mph).On July 5, 2016, between 03:18 and 03:53UTCEarth-received time, an insertion burn lasting 2,102 seconds deceleratedJunoby 542 m/s (1,780 ft/s)and changed its trajectory from ahyperbolicflyby to anelliptical, polar orbit with a period of about 53.5 days.The spacecraft successfully entered Jovian orbit on July 5, 2016, at 03:53 UTC. Juno'shighly elliptical initial polar orbit takes it within 4,200 km (2,600 mi) of the planet and out to 8.1×10^6km (5.0×10^6mi), far beyondCallisto's orbit. Aneccentricity-reducing burn, called the Period Reduction Maneuver, was planned that would drop the probe into a much shorter 14 day science orbit.Originally,Junowas expected to complete 37 orbits over 20 months before the end of its mission. Due to problems with helium valves that are important during main engine burns, mission managers announced on February 17, 2017, thatJunowould remain in its original 53-day orbit, since the chance of an engine misfire putting the spacecraft into a bad orbit was too high.Junocompleted only 12 science orbits before the end of its budgeted mission plan, ending July 2018.In June 2018, NASA extended the mission through July 2021, as described below. The orbits were carefully planned in order to minimize contact with Jupiter's denseradiation belts, which can damage spacecraft electronics and solar panels, by exploiting a gap in the radiation envelope near the planet, passing through a region of minimal radiation.TheJuno Radiation Vault, with 1-centimeter-thicktitaniumwalls (three times as thick as theGalileospacecraft body's), also aids in protectingJuno'selectronics by reducing the incoming radiation by a factor of 800.Despite the intense radiation, JunoCam and the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) were designed to endure at least eight orbits, while the Microwave Radiometer (MWR) was made to endure at least eleven orbits. All instruments are operational as of perijove 71.Although the flux of electrons close to Jupiter is about ten times as high as it is around Jupiter's moon Europa,Junowill still receive a lower total dose of radiation in its polar orbit (20Mradthrough end of mission)than theGalileoorbiterreceived in its equatorial orbit.Galileo'ssubsystems were damaged by radiation during its mission, including an LED in its data recording system. The spacecraft completed its first flyby of Jupiter (perijove1) on August 26, 2016, and captured the first images of the planet's north pole. On October 14, 2016, days prior to perijove 2 and the planned Period Reduction Maneuver, telemetry showed that some ofJuno'shelium valves were not opening properly.On October 18, 2016, some 13 hours before its second close approach to Jupiter,Junoentered intosafe mode, an operational mode engaged when its onboard computer encounters unexpected conditions. The spacecraft powered down all non-critical systems and reoriented itself to face the Sun to gather the most power. Due to this, no science operations were conducted during perijove 2. On December 11, 2016, the spacecraft completed perijove 3, with all but one instrument operating and returning data. One instrument, JIRAM, was off pending a flight software update.Perijove 4 occurred on February 2, 2017, with all instruments operating.Perijove 5 occurred on March 27, 2017.Perijove 6 took place on May 19, 2017. Although the mission's lifetime is inherently limited by radiation exposure, almost all of this dose was planned to be acquired during the perijoves. As of 2017[update], the 53.4 day orbit was planned to be maintained through July 2018 for a total of twelve science-gathering perijoves. At the end of this prime mission, the project was planned to go through a science review process by NASA'sPlanetary Science Divisionto determine if it will receive funding for an extended mission. In June 2018, NASA extended the mission operations plan to July 2021. In January 2021, NASA extended the mission operations to September 2025.In this phaseJunobegan to examine Jupiter'smajor moons,Ganymede,Europaand Io. A flyby of Ganymede occurred on June 7, 2021, 17:35UTC, coming within 1,038 km (645 mi), the closest any spacecraft has come to the moon sinceGalileoin 2000.A flyby of Europa took place on September 29, 2022, at a distance of 352 km (219 mi).Juno performed two flybys of Io on December 30, 2023, and February 3, 2024, gathering observational data on volcanic activity. From April 2024, Juno will begin a series of experiments to learn more about Jupiter's interior shape and structure. NASA originally planned todeorbitthe spacecraft into the atmosphere of Jupiter after completing 32 orbits of Jupiter, but has since extended the mission to September 2025.The controlled deorbit is intended to eliminate space debris andrisks of contaminationofpossible life-bearing moons(especially Europa) by surviving terrestrial microorganisms onboard the spacecraft in accordance with NASA'splanetary protectionguidelines. Scott Boltonof theSouthwest Research InstituteinSan Antonio,Texasis the principal investigator and is responsible for all aspects of the mission. TheJet Propulsion LaboratoryinCaliforniamanages the mission and theLockheed Martin Corporationwas responsible for the spacecraft development and construction. The mission is being carried out with the participation of several institutional partners. Coinvestigators includeToby Owenof theUniversity of Hawaii,Andrew IngersollofCalifornia Institute of Technology,Frances Bagenalof theUniversity of Colorado at Boulder, andCandy Hansenof thePlanetary Science Institute.Jack Connerneyof theGoddard Space Flight Centerserved as instrument lead. Junowas originally proposed at a cost of approximately US$700 million (fiscal year 2003) for a launch in June 2009 (equivalent to US$1197 million in 2024). NASA budgetary restrictions resulted in postponement until August 2011, and a launch on board anAtlas Vrocket in the551 configuration. As of 2019[update]the mission was projected to cost US$1.46 billion for operations and data analysis through 2022. TheJunospacecraft's suite of science instruments will: TheJunomission's scientific objectives are being achieved with a payload of nine instruments on board the spacecraft: Themicrowave radiometercomprises six antennas mounted on two of the sides of the body of the probe. They will perform measurements ofelectromagnetic waveson frequencies in themicrowaverange: 600MHz, 1.2, 2.4, 4.8, 9.6 and 22 GHz, the only microwave frequencies which are able to pass through the thick Jovian atmosphere. The radiometer will measure the abundance of water and ammonia in the deep layers of the atmosphere up to 200 bar (20 MPa; 2,900 psi) pressure or 500–600 km (310–370 mi) deep. The combination of different wavelengths and the emission angle should make it possible to obtain a temperature profile at various levels of the atmosphere. The data collected will determine how deep the atmospheric circulation is.The MWR is designed to function through orbit 11 of Jupiter.(Principal investigator: Mike Janssen,Jet Propulsion Laboratory) The spectrometer mapper JIRAM, operating in thenear infrared(between 2 and 5 μm), conducts surveys in the upper layers of the atmosphere to a depth of between 50 and 70 km (31 and 43 mi) where the pressure reaches 5 to 7 bar (500 to 700 kPa). JIRAM will provide images of the aurora in the wavelength of 3.4 μm in regions with abundantH3+ions. By measuring the heat radiated by the atmosphere of Jupiter, JIRAM can determine how clouds with water are flowing beneath the surface. It can also detectmethane,water vapor,ammoniaandphosphine. It was not required that this device meets the radiation resistance requirements.The JIRAM instrument is expected to operate through the eighth orbit of Jupiter.(Principal investigator: Alberto Adriani,Italian National Institute for Astrophysics) JIRAM's  spin-compensation mirror is stuck since PJ44, but the instrument is operational. The magnetic field investigation has three goals: mapping of the magnetic field, determining the dynamics of Jupiter's interior, and determination of the three-dimensional structure of the polar magnetosphere. The magnetometer experiment consists of the Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM), which will observe the strength and direction of the magnetic field lines, and the Advanced Stellar Compass (ASC), which will monitor the orientation of the magnetometer sensors.(Principal investigator: Jack Connerney, NASA'sGoddard Space Flight Center) The purpose of measuring gravity by radio waves is to establish a map of the distribution of mass inside Jupiter. The uneven distribution of mass in Jupiter induces small variations in gravity all along the orbit followed by the probe when it runs closer to the surface of the planet. These gravity variations drive small probe velocity changes. The purpose of radio science is to detect theDoppler effecton radio broadcasts issued byJunotoward Earth inKa-bandandX-band, which are frequency ranges that can conduct the study with fewer disruptions related to thesolar windor Jupiter'sionosphere.(Principal investigator: John Anderson,Jet Propulsion Laboratory; Principal investigator (Juno's Ka-band Translator): Luciano Iess,Sapienza University of Rome) The energetic particle detector JADE will measure the angular distribution, energy, and the velocity vector of ions and electrons atlowenergy (ions between 13eVand 20 KeV, electrons of 200 eV to 40 KeV) present in the aurora of Jupiter. On JADE, like JEDI, the electron analyzers are installed on three sides of the upper plate which allows a measure of frequency three times higher.(Principal investigator:David McComas,Southwest Research Institute) The energetic particle detector JEDI will measure the angular distribution and the velocity vector of ions and electrons athighenergy (ions between 20 keV and 1 MeV, electrons from 40 to 500 keV) present in the polarmagnetosphereof Jupiter. JEDI has three identical sensors dedicated to the study of particular ions ofhydrogen,helium,oxygenandsulfur.(Principal investigator: Barry Mauk,Applied Physics Laboratory) This instrument will identify the regions of auroral currents that define Jovian radio emissions and acceleration of the auroral particles by measuring the radio and plasma spectra in the auroral region. It will also observe the interactions betweenJupiter's atmosphereandmagnetosphere. The instrument consists of two antennae that detect radio and plasma waves.(Principal investigator: William Kurth,University of Iowa) UVS will record the wavelength, position and arrival time of detectedultravioletphotons during the time when the spectrograph slit views Jupiter during each turn of the spacecraft. The instrument will provide spectral images of the UV auroral emissions in the polar magnetosphere.(Principal investigator: G. Randall Gladstone,Southwest Research Institute) A visible light camera/telescope, included in the payload to facilitate education andpublic outreach; later re-purposed to study the dynamics of Jupiter's clouds, particularly those at the poles.It was anticipated that it would operate through only eight orbits of Jupiter ending in September 2017due to the planet's damaging radiation and magnetic field,during Juno's 47th orbit, the imager began showing hints of radiation damage. By orbit 56, nearly all the images were corrupted; the cause was identified as a damaged voltage regulator. Byannealingthe camera at a temperature of 25 °C (77 °F), the camera was brought back to operations. Junocam undergoes this operation periodically and as of July 2025 remains in operation.(Principal investigator:Michael C. Malin,Malin Space Science Systems) Juno'ssatellite bus, its main electronics and propulsion box, is ahexagonal prism. Junois the first mission to Jupiter to usesolar panelsinstead of theradioisotope thermoelectric generators(RTG) used byPioneer 10,Pioneer 11, theVoyager program,Ulysses,Cassini–Huygens,New Horizons, and theGalileoorbiter.It is also the farthest solar-powered trip in the history of space exploration.Once in orbit around Jupiter,Junoreceives only 4% as much sunlight as it would onEarth, but the global shortage ofplutonium-238at the time,as well as advances made in solar cell technology over the past several decades, makes it economically preferable to use solar panels of practical size to provide power at a distance of 5a.u.from theSun. TheJunospacecraft uses three solar panels symmetrically arranged around the spacecraft. Shortly after it cleared Earth's atmosphere, the panels were deployed. Two of the panels have four hinged segments each, and the third panel has three segments and amagnetometer. Each panel is 2.7 by 8.9 m (8 ft 10 in by 29 ft 2 in)providing 50 square metres (540 sq ft) of active cells– the largest on any NASA deep-space probe at the time of launching. The combined mass of the three panels is nearly 340 kg (750 lb).If the panels were optimized to operate at Earth, they would produce 12 to 14 kilowatts of power. Only about 486 watts were generated whenJunoarrived at Jupiter, projected to decline to near 420 watts as radiation degrades the cells.The solar panels will remain in sunlight continuously from launch through the end of the mission, except for short periods during the operation of the main engine and eclipses by Jupiter. A central power distribution and drive unit monitors the power that is generated by the solar panels and distributes it to instruments, heaters, and experiment sensors, as well as to batteries that are charged when excess power is available. Two 55Ahlithium-ionbatteries that are able to withstand the radiation environment of Jupiter provide power whenJunopasses through eclipse. Junousesin-band signaling(\"tones\") for several critical operations as well as status reporting during cruise mode,but it is expected to be used infrequently. Communications are via the 34 m (112 ft) and 70 m (230 ft)antennasof theNASA Deep Space Network(DSN) utilizing anX-banddirect link.The command and data processing of theJunospacecraft includes a flight computer capable of providing about 50 Mbit/s of instrument throughput. Gravity science subsystems use the X-band andKa-bandDopplertracking and autoranging. Due to telecommunications constraints,Junowill only be able to return about 40 megabytes of JunoCam data during each 11-day orbital period, limiting the number of images that are captured and transmitted during each orbit to somewhere between 10 and 100 depending on the compression level used.[needs update]The overall amount of data downlinked on each orbit is significantly higher and used for the mission's scientific instruments; JunoCam is intended for public outreach and is thus secondary to the science data. This is comparable to the previousGalileomissionthat orbited Jupiter, which captured thousands of imagesdespite its slow data rate of 1000 bit/s (at maximum compression level) due to thefailure of its high gain antenna. The communication system is also used as part of theGravity Scienceexperiment. Junouses aLEROS 1bmain engine withhypergolic propellant, manufactured byMoog IncinWestcott, Buckinghamshire, England.It uses approx. 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) ofhydrazineandnitrogen tetroxidefor propulsion, including 1,232 kg (2,716 lb) available for the Jupiter Orbit Insertion plus subsequent orbital maneuvers. The engine provides a thrust of 645newtons. The engine bell is enclosed in a debris shield fixed to the spacecraft body, and is used for major burns. For control of the vehicle's orientation (attitude control) and to perform trajectory correction maneuvers,Junoutilizes amonopropellantreaction control system(RCS) consisting of twelve small thrusters that are mounted on four engine modules. Junocarries a plaque to Jupiter, dedicated toGalileo Galilei. The plaque was provided by theItalian Space Agency(ASI) and measures 7.1 by 5.1 cm (2.8 by 2.0 in). It is made of flight-gradealuminumand weighs 6 g (0.21 oz).The plaque depicts a portrait of Galileo and a text in Galileo's own handwriting, penned in January 1610, while observing what would later be known to be theGalilean moons.The text translates as: On the 11th it was in this formation – and the star closest to Jupiter was half the size than the other and very close to the other so that during the previous nights all of the three observed stars looked of the same dimension and among them equally afar; so that it is evident that around Jupiter there are three moving stars invisible till this time to everyone. The spacecraft also carries threeLego minifiguresrepresenting Galileo Galilei, the Roman godJupiter, and his sister and wife, the goddessJuno. In Roman mythology, Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief. Juno was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiter's true nature. The Juno minifigure holds a magnifying glass as a sign of searching for the truth, and Jupiter holds a lightning bolt. The third Lego crew member, Galileo Galilei, has his telescope with him on the journey.The figurines were produced in partnership between NASA andLegoas part of an outreach program to inspire children's interest inscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics(STEM).Although most Lego toys are made of plastic, Lego specially made these minifigures of aluminum to endure the extreme conditions of space flight. Among early results,Junogathered information about Jovian lightning that revised earlier theories.Junoprovided the first views of Jupiter's north pole, as well as providing insight about Jupiter's aurorae, magnetic field, and atmosphere. In 2021, analysis of the frequency of interplanetary dust impacts (primarily on the backs of the solar panels), as Juno passed between Earth and the asteroid belt, indicated that this dust, which causes theZodiacal light, comes fromMars, rather than from comets or asteroids that come from the outer solar system, as was previously thought. Juno made many discoveries that are challenging existing theories about Jupiter's formation. When Juno flew over the poles of Jupiter it imaged clusters of stable cyclones that exist at the poles.It found that the magnetosphere of Jupiter is uneven and chaotic. Using its Microwave Radiometer, Juno found that the red and white bands that can be seen on Jupiter extend hundreds of kilometers into the Jovian atmosphere, yet the interior of Jupiter is not evenly mixed. This has resulted in the theory that Jupiter does not have a solid core as previously thought, but a \"fuzzy\" core made of pieces of rock andmetallic hydrogen. This peculiar core may be a result of a collision that happened early on in Jupiter's formation. In April 2020,Junodetected ameteor impact on Jupiter, with estimated mass of 250–5000 kg. Results fromJunoon storms suggests that they are far taller than expected, with some extending 60 miles (100 kilometers) below the cloud tops and others, including the Great Red Spot, extending over 200 miles (350 kilometers). WithJunotraveling low over Jupiter's cloud deck at about 130,000 mph (209,000 kph) Juno scientists were able to measure velocity changes as small as 0.01 millimeter per second using a NASA's Deep Space Network tracking antenna, from a distance of more than 400 million miles (650 million kilometers). This enabled the team to constrain the depth of the Great Red Spot to about 300 miles (500 kilometers) below the cloud tops. The new results show that the cyclones are warmer on top, with lower atmospheric densities, while they are colder at the bottom, with higher densities. Anticyclones, which rotate in the opposite direction, are colder at the top but warmer at the bottom.\n",

            "TheVoyager programis an American scientific program that employs twointerstellar probes,Voyager 1andVoyager 2. They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment to explore the two gas giantsJupiterandSaturnand potentially also the ice giants, Uranus and Neptune—tofly near themwhile collecting data for transmission back to Earth. AfterVoyager 1successfully completed its flyby of Saturn and its moonTitan, it was decided to sendVoyager 2on flybys ofUranusandNeptune. After the planetary flybys were complete, decisions were made to keep the probes in operation to exploreinterstellar spaceand the outer regions of the Solar System. On 25 August 2012, data fromVoyager 1indicated that it had entered interstellar space.On 5 November 2019, data fromVoyager 2indicated that it also had entered interstellar space.On 4 November 2019, scientists reported that on 5 November 2018, theVoyager 2probe had officially reached theinterstellar medium(ISM), a region ofouter spacebeyond the influence of thesolar wind, as didVoyager 1in 2012.In August 2018, NASA confirmed, based on results by theNew Horizonsspacecraft, the existence of a \"hydrogen wall\" at the outer edges of the Solar System that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft. As of 2024,[update]the Voyagers are still in operation beyond the outer boundary of theheliosphereininterstellar space.Voyager 1is moving with a velocity of 61,198 kilometers per hour (38,027 mph), or 17 km/s, (10.5 miles/second) relative to the Sun, and is 24,475,900,000 kilometers (1.52086×1010mi) from the Sunreaching a distance of 162AU(24.2billionkm; 15.1 billionmi) from Earth as of May 25, 2024.As of 2024[update],Voyager 2is moving with a velocity of 55,347 kilometers per hour (34,391 mph), or 15 km/s, relative to the Sun, and is 20,439,100,000 kilometers (1.27003×1010mi) from the Sunreaching a distance of 136.627AU(20.4billionkm; 12.7 billionmi) from Earth as of May 25, 2024. The two Voyagers are the only human-made objects to date that have passed into interstellar space — a record they will hold until at least the 2040s — andVoyager 1is the farthest human-made object from Earth. Voyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one expected, and promises to outlive its inventors. Like a great painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers. The two Voyager space probes were originally conceived as part of thePlanetary Grand Tourplanned during the late 1960s and early 70s that aimed to exploreJupiter,Saturn, Saturn's moonTitan,Uranus,Neptune, andPluto. The mission originated from theGrand Tour program, conceptualized byGary Flandro, anaerospace engineerat the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in 1964, which leveraged a rareplanetary alignmentoccurring once every 175 years.This alignment allowed a craft to reach allouter planetsusinggravitational assists. The mission was to send several pairs of probes and gained momentum in 1966 when it was endorsed byNASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory. However, in December 1971, the Grand Tour mission was canceled when funding was redirected to theSpace Shuttle program. In 1972, a scaled-down (four planets, two identical spacecraft) mission was proposed, utilizing a spacecraft derived from theMarinerseries, initially intended to beMariner 11andMariner 12. Thegravity-assisttechnique, successfully demonstrated byMariner 10, would be used to achieve significant velocity changes by maneuvering through an intermediate planet'sgravitational fieldto minimize time towards Saturn.The spacecrafts were then moved into a separate program namedMariner Jupiter-Saturn(alsoMariner Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus,MJS, orMJSU), part of theMariner program, later renamed because it was thought that the design of the two space probes had progressed sufficiently beyond that of the Mariner family to merit a separate name. On March 4, 1977,NASAannounced a competition to rename the mission, believing the existing name was not appropriate as the mission had differed significantly from previousMarinermissions.Voyagerwas chosen as the new name, referencing an earlier suggestion byWilliam Pickering, who had proposed the nameNavigator. Due to the name change occurring close to launch, the probes were still occasionally referred to as Mariner 11 and Mariner 12, or even Voyager 11 and Voyager 12. Two mission trajectories were established: JST aimed at Jupiter, Saturn, and enhancing aTitanflyby, while JSX served as a contingency plan. JST focused on a Titan flyby, while JSX provided a flexible mission plan. If JST succeeded, JSX could proceed with the Grand Tour, but in case of failure, JSX could be redirected for a separate Titan flyby, forfeiting the Grand Tour opportunity.The second probe, nowVoyager 2, followed the JSX trajectory, granting it the option to continue on to Uranus and Neptune. UponVoyager 1completing its main objectives at Saturn, Voyager 2 received a mission extension, enabling it to proceed to Uranus and Neptune. This allowed Voyager 2 to diverge from the originally planned JST trajectory. The probes would be launched in August or September 1977, with their main objective being to compare the characteristics of Jupiter and Saturn, such as theiratmospheres,magnetic fields, particle environments,ring systems, andmoons. They would fly by planets and moons in either a JST or JSX trajectory. After completing their flybys, the probes would communicate with Earth, relaying vital data using theirmagnetometers,spectrometers, and other instruments to detectinterstellar,solar, andcosmic radiation. Their radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) would limit the maximum communication time with the probes to roughly adecade. Following their primary missions, the probes would continue to drift into interstellar space. Voyager 2was the first to be launched. Its trajectory was designed to allow flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.Voyager 1was launched afterVoyager 2, but along a shorter and faster trajectory that was designed to provide an optimal flyby of Saturn's moonTitan,which was known to be quite large and to possess a dense atmosphere. This encounter sentVoyager 1out of the plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission.HadVoyager 1been unable to perform the Titan flyby, the trajectory ofVoyager 2could have been altered to explore Titan, forgoing any visit to Uranus and Neptune.Voyager 1was not launched on a trajectory that would have allowed it to continue to Uranus and Neptune, but could have continued from Saturn to Pluto without exploring Titan. During the 1990s,Voyager 1overtook the slower deep-space probesPioneer 10andPioneer 11to become the most distant human-made object from Earth, a record that it will keep for the foreseeable future. TheNew Horizonsprobe, which had a higher launch velocity thanVoyager 1, is travelling more slowly due to the extra speedVoyager 1gained from its flybys of Jupiter and Saturn.Voyager 1and Pioneer 10 are the most widely separated human-made objects anywhere since they are travelling in roughly opposite directions from theSolar System. In December 2004,Voyager 1crossed thetermination shock, where the solar wind is slowed to subsonic speed, and entered theheliosheath, where the solar wind is compressed and made turbulent due to interactions with theinterstellar medium. On 10 December 2007,Voyager 2also reached the termination shock, about 1.6 billion kilometres (1 billion miles) closer to the Sun than from whereVoyager 1first crossed it, indicating that the Solar System isasymmetrical. In 2010Voyager 1reported that the outward velocity of the solar wind had dropped to zero, and scientists predicted it was nearinginterstellar space.In 2011, data from the Voyagers determined that the heliosheath was not smooth, but filled with giantmagneticbubbles. It was theorized that they formed when themagnetic fieldof the Sun became warped at the edge of the Solar System. In June 2012, scientists at NASA reported thatVoyager 1was very close to entering interstellar space, which was indicated by a sharp rise inhigh-energy particlesfrom outside the Solar System.In September 2013, NASA announced thatVoyager 1had crossed theheliopauseon 25 August 2012, making it the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space. In December 2018, NASA announced thatVoyager 2had crossed the heliopause on 5 November 2018, making it the second spacecraft to enter interstellar space. As of 2017[update]Voyager 1andVoyager 2continued to monitor conditions in the outer expanses of the Solar System.The Voyager spacecraft were expected to be able to operate science instruments through 2020, when limited power would require instruments to be deactivated one by one. It was expected that circa 2025 there would no longer be sufficient power to operate any scientific instruments. In July 2019, a revised power management plan was implemented for the two probes' dwindling power supplies. The Voyager spacecraft each weighed 815 kilograms (1,797 pounds) at launch, but after fuel usage are now about 733 kilograms (1,616 pounds).Of this weight, each spacecraft carries 105 kilograms (231 pounds) of scientific instruments.The identical Voyager spacecraft use three-axis-stabilizedguidance systemsthat usegyroscopicandaccelerometerinputs to theirattitude controlcomputers to point theirhigh-gain antennastowardsthe Earthand their scientific instruments towards their targets, sometimes with the help of a movable instrument platform for the smaller instruments and theelectronic photographysystem. The diagram shows the high-gain antenna (HGA) with a 3.7 m (12 ft) diameter dish attached to the hollowdecagonalelectronicscontainer. There is also a spherical tank that contains thehydrazinemonopropellantfuel. TheVoyager Golden Recordis attached to one of the bus sides. The angled square panel to the right is the optical calibration target and excess heat radiator. The threeradioisotope thermoelectric generators(RTGs) are mounted end-to-end on the lower boom. The scan platform comprises: the Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) (largest camera at top right); the Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS) just above the IRIS; the two Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)vidicon camerasto the left of the UVS; and the Photopolarimeter System (PPS) under the ISS. Only five investigation teams are still supported, though data is collected for two additional instruments.The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) and a single eight-trackdigital tape recorder(DTR) provide the data handling functions. The FDS configures each instrument and controls instrument operations. It also collects engineering and science data and formats the data fortransmission. The DTR is used to record high-ratePlasmaWave Subsystem (PWS) data, which is played back every six months. The Imaging Science Subsystem made up of a wide-angle and a narrow-angle camera is a modified version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights. The Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two television-type cameras, each with eight filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons. One has a low resolution 200 mm (7.9 in)focal lengthwide-angle lens with anapertureof f/3 (the wide-angle camera), while the other uses a higher resolution 1,500 mm (59 in) narrow-angle f/8.5 lens (the narrow-angle camera). Three spacecraft were built,Voyager 1(VGR 77-1),Voyager 2(VGR 77-3), and test spare model (VGR 77-2). There are three different computer types on the Voyager spacecraft, two of each kind, sometimes used for redundancy. They are proprietary, custom-built computers built fromCMOSandTTLmedium-scale CMOS integrated circuits and discrete components, mostly from the7400 seriesofTexas Instruments.Total number ofwordsamong the six computers is about 32K. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have identical computer systems. The Computer Command System (CCS), the central controller of the spacecraft, has two 18-bit word, interrupt-type processors with 4096 words each of non-volatileplated-wire memory. During most of the Voyager mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used non-redundantly to increase the command and processing capability of the spacecraft. The CCS is nearly identical to the system flown on the Viking spacecraft. The Flight Data System (FDS) is two 16-bit word machines with modular memories and 8198 words each. The Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS) is two 18-bit word machines with 4096 words each. Unlike the other on-board instruments, the operation of the cameras forvisible lightis not autonomous, but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the on-boarddigital computers, the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). More recent space probes, since about 1990, usually have completelyautonomouscameras. The computer command subsystem (CCS) controls the cameras. The CCS contains fixedcomputer programssuch as command decoding, fault detection, and correction routines, antenna-pointing routines, and spacecraft sequencing routines. This computer is an improved version of the one that was used in theVikingorbiter.The hardware in both custom-built CCS subsystems in the Voyagers is identical. There is only a minor software modification for one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks. According to Guinness Book of Records, CCS holds record of \"longest period of continual operation for a computer\". It has been running continuously since 20 August 1977. The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) controls the spacecraft orientation (its attitude). It keeps the high-gain antenna pointing towards the Earth, controls attitude changes, and points the scan platform. The custom-built AACS systems on both craft are identical. It has been erroneously reportedon theInternetthat the Voyager space probes were controlled by a version of theRCA 1802(RCA CDP1802 \"COSMAC\"microprocessor), but such claims are not supported by the primary design documents. The CDP1802 microprocessor was used later in theGalileospace probe, which was designed and built years later. The digital control electronics of the Voyagers were not based on a microprocessor integrated-circuit chip. Theuplinkcommunications are executed viaS-bandmicrowave communications. Thedownlinkcommunications are carried out by anX-bandmicrowavetransmitter on board the spacecraft, with an S-band transmitter as a back-up. All long-range communications to and from the two Voyagers have been carried out using their 3.7-meter (12 ft) high-gain antennas. The high-gain antenna has a beamwidth of 0.5° for X-band, and 2.3° for S-band.: 17(The low-gain antenna has a 7 dB gain and 60° beamwidth.): 17 Because of theinverse-square lawinradio communications, the digital data rates used in the downlinks from the Voyagers have been continually decreasing the farther that they get from the Earth. For example, the data rate used from Jupiter was about 115,000 bits per second. That was halved at the distance of Saturn, and it has gone down continually since then.Some measures were taken on the ground along the way to reduce the effects of the inverse-square law. In between 1982 and 1985, the diameters of the three mainparabolic dish antennasof theDeep Space Networkwere increased from 64 to 70 m (210 to 230 ft): 34dramatically increasing their areas for gathering weak microwave signals. Whilst the craft were between Saturn and Uranus the onboard software was upgraded to do a degree of image compression and to use a more efficientReed-Solomon error-correcting encoding.: 33 Then between 1986 and 1989, new techniques were brought into play to combine the signals from multiple antennas on the ground into one, more powerful signal, in a kind of anantenna array.: 34This was done atGoldstone, California,Canberra (Australia), andMadrid (Spain)using the additional dish antennas available there. Also, in Australia, theParkes Radio Telescopewas brought into the array in time for the fly-by of Neptune in 1989. In the United States, theVery Large ArrayinNew Mexicowas brought into temporary use along with the antennas of the Deep Space Network at Goldstone.: 34Using this new technology of antenna arrays helped to compensate for the immense radio distance from Neptune to the Earth. Electrical poweris supplied by threeMHW-RTGradioisotope thermoelectric generators(RTGs). They are powered byplutonium-238(distinct from thePu-239isotope used in nuclear weapons) and provided approximately 470Wat 30voltsDCwhen the spacecraft was launched. Plutonium-238 decays with ahalf-lifeof 87.74 years,so RTGs using Pu-238 will lose a factor of 1−0.5(1/87.74)= 0.79% of their power output per year. In 2011, 34 years after launch, the thermal power generated by such an RTG would be reduced to (1/2)(34/87.74)≈ 76% of its initial power. The RTGthermocouples, which convert thermal power into electricity, also degrade over time reducing available electric power below this calculated level. By 7 October 2011 the power generated byVoyager 1andVoyager 2had dropped to 267.9 W and 269.2 W respectively, about 57% of the power at launch. The level of power output was better than pre-launch predictions based on a conservative thermocouple degradation model. As the electrical power decreases, spacecraft loads must be turned off, eliminating some capabilities. There may be insufficient power for communications by 2032. The Voyager primary mission was completed in 1989, with the close flyby of Neptune byVoyager 2. The Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) is a mission extension, which began when the two spacecraft had already been in flight for over 12 years.The Heliophysics Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate conducted a Heliophysics Senior Review in 2008. The panel found that the VIM \"is a mission that is absolutely imperative to continue\" and that VIM \"funding near the optimal level and increased DSN (Deep Space Network) support is warranted.\" The main objective of the VIM was to extend the exploration of the Solar System beyond the outer planets to theheliopause(the farthest extent at which the Sun's radiation predominates over interstellar winds) and if possible even beyond. Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause boundary in 2012, followed by Voyager 2 in 2018. Passing through the heliopause boundary has allowed both spacecraft to make measurements of the interstellar fields, particles and waves unaffected by thesolar wind. Two significant findings so far have been the discovery of a region of magnetic bubblesand no indication of an expected shift in the Solar magnetic field. The entireVoyager 2scan platform, including all of the platform instruments, was switched off in 1998. All platform instruments onVoyager 1, except for the ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS)have also been switched off. TheVoyager 1scan platform was scheduled to go off-line in late 2000 but has been left on to investigate UV emission from the upwind direction.\n",
            "UVS data are still captured but scans are no longer possible. Gyro operations ended in 2016 forVoyager 2and in 2017 forVoyager 1. Gyro operations are used to rotate the probe 360 degrees six times per year to measure the magnetic field of the spacecraft, which is then subtracted from the magnetometer science data. On 14 November 2023, Voyager 1 stopped sending all telemetry and data, though the signal was still present.  After months of experiments, made considerably more difficult by the 45 hour round trip time, the cause was traced to a bad memory chip.  New software was written to avoid the bad memory block, and engineering data resumed on 20 April 2024.Science data from two instruments resumed in May 2024,and full recovery (of all science instruments that were still powered up) was in June 2024.For more details of this intricate operation, seeVoyager 1. The two spacecraft continue to operate, with some loss in subsystem redundancy but retain the capability to return scientific data from a full complement of Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) science instruments. Both spacecraft also have adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to continue operating and collecting science data through at least 2026.Though additional science instruments may need to be turned off, the spacecraft are expected to be able to communicate until 2036, in the absence of additional failures. By the start of VIM,Voyager 1was at a distance of 40AUfrom the Earth, whileVoyager 2was at 31 AU. VIM is in three phases: termination shock, heliosheath exploration, and interstellar exploration phase. The spacecraft began VIM in an environment controlled by the Sun's magnetic field, with the plasma particles being dominated by those contained in the expanding supersonic solar wind. This is the characteristic environment of the termination shock phase. At some distance from the Sun, the supersonic solar wind will be held back from further expansion by the interstellar wind. The first feature encountered by a spacecraft as a result of this interaction – between interstellar wind and solar wind – was the termination shock, where the solar wind slows to subsonic speed, and large changes in plasma flow direction and magnetic field orientation occur.Voyager 1completed the phase of termination shock in December 2004 at a distance of 94 AU, whileVoyager 2completed it in August 2007 at a distance of 84 AU. After entering into the heliosheath, the spacecraft were in an area that is dominated by the Sun's magnetic field and solar wind particles. After passing through the heliosheath, the two Voyagers began the phase of interstellar exploration. The outer boundary of the heliosheath is called the heliopause. This is the region where the Sun's influence begins to decrease and interstellar space can be detected. Voyager 1is escaping the Solar System at the speed of 3.6 AU per year 35° north of theeclipticin the general direction of thesolar apexinHercules, whileVoyager 2's speed is about 3.3 AU per year, heading 48° south of the ecliptic. The Voyager spacecraft will eventually go on to the stars. In about40,000 years,Voyager 1will be within 1.6light years(ly) of AC+79 3888, also known asGliese 445, which is approaching the Sun. In 40,000 yearsVoyager 2will be within 1.7 ly ofRoss 248(another star which is approaching the Sun), and in296,000 yearsit will pass within 4.6 ly ofSirius, which is the brightest star in the night-sky.The spacecraft are not expected to collide with a star for 1 sextillion (1020) years. In October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in thespacebeyond theSolar System, as detected by the Voyagerspace probes. According to the researchers, this implies that \"the density gradient is a large-scale feature of theVLISM(very localinterstellar medium) in the general direction of theheliospheric nose\". Both spacecraft carry a 12-inch (30 cm) golden phonograph record that contains pictures and sounds of Earth, symbolic directions on the cover for playing the record, and data detailing the location of Earth.The record is intended as a combinationtime capsuleand an interstellar message to any civilization, alien or far-future human, that may recover either of the Voyagers. The contents of this record were selected by a committee that includedTimothy Ferrisand was chaired byCarl Sagan. Pale Blue Dotis a photograph ofEarthtaken on February 14, 1990, by theVoyager 1space probefrom a distance of approximately6 billionkilometers (3.7 billionmiles, 40.5AU), as part of that day'sFamily Portraitseries of images of theSolar System.The Voyager program's discoveries during the primary phase of its mission, including new close-up color photos of the major planets, were regularly documented by print and electronic media outlets. Among the best-known of these is an image of the Earth as aPale Blue Dot, taken in 1990 byVoyager 1, and popularized by Carl Sagan, Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us....The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.... To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.\n",
