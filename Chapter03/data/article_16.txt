We take advantage of ourautonomous driving platform Anniewayto develop novel challenging real-world computer vision benchmarks. Our tasks of interest are: stereo, optical flow, visual odometry, 3D object detection and 3D tracking. For this purpose, we equipped a standard station wagon with two high-resolution color and grayscale video cameras. Accurate ground truth is provided by a Velodyne laser scanner and a GPS localization system. Our datsets are captured by driving around the mid-size city ofKarlsruhe, in rural areas and on highways. Up to 15 cars and 30 pedestrians are visible per image. Besides providing all data in raw format, we extract benchmarks for each task. For each of our benchmarks, we also provide an evaluation metric and this evaluation website. Preliminary experiments show that methods ranking high on established benchmarks such asMiddleburyperform below average when being moved outside the laboratory to the real world. Our goal is to reduce this bias and complement existing benchmarks by providing real-world benchmarks with novel difficulties to the community.To get started, grab a cup of your favorite beverage and watch our video trailer (5 minutes): All datasets and benchmarks on this page are copyright by us and published under theCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0License.
