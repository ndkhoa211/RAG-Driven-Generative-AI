such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency. Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,

Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment. We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables

tailored for document parsing. Its core component is PaddleOCR-VL-0.9B, a
compact yet powerful vision-language model (VLM) that integrates a NaViT-style
dynamic resolution visual encoder with the ERNIE-4.5-0.3B language model to
enable accurate element recognition. This innovative model efficiently supports
109 languages and excels in recognizing complex elements (e.g., text, tables,
formulas, and charts), while maintaining minimal resource consumption. Through
comprehensive evaluations on widely used public benchmarks and in-house
benchmarks, PaddleOCR-VL achieves SOTA performance in both page-level document
parsing and element-level recognition. It significantly outperforms existing
solutions, exhibits strong competitiveness against top-tier VLMs, and delivers
fast inference speeds. These strengths make it highly suitable for practical
deployment in real-world scenarios. In this report, we propose PaddleOCR-VL, a SOTA and resource-efficient model

tokens for training language models. However, these documents come in a
diversity of types with differing formats and visual layouts that pose a

image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust

turn-based dialogue systems, as they allow simultaneous bidirectional
communication, closely mirroring human-human interactions. However, achieving
low latency and natural interactions in full-duplex dialogue systems remains a
significant challenge, especially considering human conversation dynamics such
as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech. In this paper, we
introduce a novel End-to-End GPT-based model OmniFlatten for full-duplex
conversation, capable of effectively modeling the complex behaviors inherent to
natural conversations with low latency. To achieve full-duplex communication
capabilities, we propose a multi-stage post-training scheme that progressively
adapts a text-based large language model (LLM) backbone into a speech-text
dialogue LLM, capable of generating text and speech in real time, without
modifying the architecture of the backbone LLM. The training process comprises
three stages: modality alignment, half-duplex dialogue learning, and
full-duplex dialogue learning. Throughout all training stages, we standardize
the data using a flattening operation, which allows us to unify the training
methods and the model architecture across different modalities and tasks. Our
approach offers a straightforward modeling technique and a promising research
direction for developing efficient and natural end-to-end full-duplex spoken
dialogue systems. Audio samples of dialogues generated by OmniFlatten can be

yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and
synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow
retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce
PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified
reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability.
PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from
AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward
signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction
adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further
enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool
failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This
highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce
efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents. The model and inference

generating contextually coherent responses, yet their fixed context windows
pose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged
multi-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric
architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting,
consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations.
Building on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that
leverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational
structures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on
LOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six baseline
categories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context
approach that processes the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source
memory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory
management platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently
outperform all existing memory systems across four question categories:
single-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves 26%
relative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with
graph memory achieves around 2% higher overall score than the base
configuration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational
overhead compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91%
lower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost, offering a compelling
balance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment
constraints. Our findings highlight critical role of structured, persistent

emergence of data agents--autonomous systems designed to orchestrate Data + AI
ecosystems for tackling complex data-related tasks. However, the term "data
agent" currently suffers from terminological ambiguity and inconsistent
adoption, conflating simple query responders with sophisticated autonomous
architectures. This terminological ambiguity fosters mismatched user
expectations, accountability challenges, and barriers to industry growth.
Inspired by the SAE J3016 standard for driving automation, this survey
introduces the first systematic hierarchical taxonomy for data agents,
comprising six levels that delineate and trace progressive shifts in autonomy,
from manual operations (L0) to a vision of generative, fully autonomous data
agents (L5), thereby clarifying capability boundaries and responsibility
allocation. Through this lens, we offer a structured review of existing
research arranged by increasing autonomy, encompassing specialized data agents
for data management, preparation, and analysis, alongside emerging efforts
toward versatile, comprehensive systems with enhanced autonomy. We further
analyze critical evolutionary leaps and technical gaps for advancing data
agents, especially the ongoing L2-to-L3 transition, where data agents evolve
from procedural execution to autonomous orchestration. Finally, we conclude
with a forward-looking roadmap, envisioning the advent of proactive, generative

gradually become the mainstream in the industry due to their high naturalness
and powerful zero-shot voice cloning capabilities.Here, we introduce the
IndexTTS system, which is mainly based on the XTTS and Tortoise model. We add
some novel improvements. Specifically, in Chinese scenarios, we adopt a hybrid
modeling method that combines characters and pinyin, making the pronunciations
of polyphonic characters and long-tail characters controllable. We also
performed a comparative analysis of the Vector Quantization (VQ) with
Finite-Scalar Quantization (FSQ) for codebook utilization of acoustic speech
tokens. To further enhance the effect and stability of voice cloning, we
introduce a conformer-based speech conditional encoder and replace the
speechcode decoder with BigVGAN2. Compared with XTTS, it has achieved
significant improvements in naturalness, content consistency, and zero-shot
voice cloning. As for the popular TTS systems in the open-source, such as
Fish-Speech, CosyVoice2, FireRedTTS and F5-TTS, IndexTTS has a relatively
simple training process, more controllable usage, and faster inference speed.
Moreover, its performance surpasses that of these systems. Our demos are
available at https://index-tts.github.io. Recently, large language model (LLM) based text-to-speech (TTS) systems have
gradually become the mainstream in the industry due to their high naturalness
and powerful zero-shot voice cloning capabilities.Here, we introduce the
IndexTTS system, which is mainly based on the XTTS and Tortoise model. We add
some novel improvements. Specifically, in Chinese scenarios, we adopt a hybrid
modeling method that combines characters and pinyin, making the pronunciations
of polyphonic characters and long-tail characters controllable. We also
performed a comparative analysis of the Vector Quantization (VQ) with
Finite-Scalar Quantization (FSQ) for codebook utilization of acoustic speech
tokens. To further enhance the effect and stability of voice cloning, we
introduce a conformer-based speech conditional encoder and replace the

edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric (CMP) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true CMP is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating CMP
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with
the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based
data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain
fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their
reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,
the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of
automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to
analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science
tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates
the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to
progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world
environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework
that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,
DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data
question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data
research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze
outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary
LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,
paving the way toward autonomous data science. Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research

model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving

for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a

large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models. We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --

3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data

that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model

approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion

critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a

superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,

However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source

diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the

AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative

fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

seeking and multi-step reasoning. Recent progress in agentic systems,
exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous
multi-step research. In this work, we present a cohesive paradigm for building
end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and
training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1)
browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised
fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for
enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on
the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information
seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of
WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our

LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap. Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in

knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web

abilities, capable of solving highly challenging information-seeking problems.
However, most research remains primarily text-centric, overlooking visual
information in the real world. This makes multimodal Deep Research highly
challenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in
perception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared
to text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a
multi-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language
reasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal
trajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep
reasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning.
To better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose
BrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex
information retrieval involving both visual and textual information.
Experimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary
baseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA
benchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal

artificial intelligence by enabling solutions to complex, open-ended tasks
through web-based information-seeking (IS) capabilities. The scarcity of
high-quality training data has limited the development of IS agents. Existing
approaches typically adopt an information-driven paradigm that first collects
web data and then generates questions based on the retrieval. However, this may
lead to inconsistency between information structure and reasoning structure,
question and answer. To mitigate, we propose a formalization-driven IS data
synthesis framework WebShaper to construct a dataset. WebShaper systematically
formalizes IS tasks through set theory. Central to the formalization is the
concept of Knowledge Projections (KP), which enables precise control over
reasoning structure by KP operation compositions. During synthesis, we begin by
creating seed tasks, then use a multi-step expansion process. At each step, an
agentic Expander expands the current formal question more complex with
retrieval and validation tools based on our formalization. We train our model
on the synthesized dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that WebShaper

the current state-of-the-art system, MemGPT, in the Deep Memory Retrieval (DMR)
benchmark. Additionally, Zep excels in more comprehensive and challenging
evaluations than DMR that better reflect real-world enterprise use cases. While
existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks for large language
model (LLM)-based agents are limited to static document retrieval, enterprise
applications demand dynamic knowledge integration from diverse sources
including ongoing conversations and business data. Zep addresses this
fundamental limitation through its core component Graphiti -- a
temporally-aware knowledge graph engine that dynamically synthesizes both
unstructured conversational data and structured business data while maintaining
historical relationships. In the DMR benchmark, which the MemGPT team
established as their primary evaluation metric, Zep demonstrates superior
performance (94.8% vs 93.4%). Beyond DMR, Zep's capabilities are further
validated through the more challenging LongMemEval benchmark, which better
reflects enterprise use cases through complex temporal reasoning tasks. In this
evaluation, Zep achieves substantial results with accuracy improvements of up
to 18.5% while simultaneously reducing response latency by 90% compared to

linguistic features, handling polyphonic expressions, and producing
natural-sounding multilingual speech - capabilities that are crucial for future
AI applications. In this paper, we present Fish-Speech, a novel framework that
implements a serial fast-slow Dual Autoregressive (Dual-AR) architecture to
enhance the stability of Grouped Finite Scalar Vector Quantization (GFSQ) in
sequence generation tasks. This architecture improves codebook processing
efficiency while maintaining high-fidelity outputs, making it particularly
effective for AI interactions and voice cloning.
  Fish-Speech leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for linguistic feature
extraction, eliminating the need for traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P)
conversion and thereby streamlining the synthesis pipeline and enhancing
multilingual support. Additionally, we developed FF-GAN through GFSQ to achieve
superior compression ratios and near 100\% codebook utilization.
  Our approach addresses key limitations of current TTS systems while providing
a foundation for more sophisticated, context-aware speech synthesis.

perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language
Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance,
it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We
introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA
models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first
systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present
key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and
action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module
with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into
the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only
a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate
that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also
offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the
proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a
powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly
lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model. Project page:

dialogue text before synthesis and produce a single, inseparable speech
containing all voices, making them unsuitable for interactive chat; moreover,
they suffer from unstable synthesis, inaccurate speaker transitions, and
incoherent prosody. In this work, we present FireRedTTS-2, a long-form
streaming TTS system for multi-speaker dialogue generation, delivering stable,
natural speech with reliable speaker switching and context-aware prosody. A new
12.5Hz streaming speech tokenizer accelerates training and inference, extends
maximum dialogue length, encodes richer semantics to stabilize text-to-token
modeling and supports high-fidelity streaming generation for real-time
applications. We adopt a text-speech interleaved format, concatenating
speaker-labeled text with aligned speech tokens in chronological order, and
model it with a dual-transformer: a large decoder-only transformer predicts
tokens at the first layer, and a smaller one completes subsequent layers.
Experimental results show that FireRedTTS-2 integrates seamlessly with chat
frameworks and, with minimal fine-tuning, produces emotionally expressive
speech guided by implicit contextual cues. In podcast generation, it surpasses
existing systems including MoonCast, Zipvoice-Dialogue, and MOSS-TTSD in
objective intelligibility, speaker-turn reliability, and perceived naturalness
with context-consistent prosody. Our demos are available at

both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially

comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on

Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on
explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue
instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user
intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual
instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue,
environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address
this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor
framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention
recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses
auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition,
while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training
data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build
OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640
backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation
and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based
baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and

has been closely co-designed with several key PyTorch core components including
Tensor implementation, dispatcher system, and CUDA memory caching allocator, to
provide non-intrusive user experiences and high training efficiency.
Additionally, FSDP natively incorporates a range of techniques and settings to

replicates the model on every computational resource to generate gradients
independently and then communicates those gradients at each iteration to keep
model replicas consistent. Despite the conceptual simplicity of the technique,
the subtle dependencies between computation and communication make it
non-trivial to optimize the distributed training efficiency. As of v1.5,
PyTorch natively provides several techniques to accelerate distributed data

(LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and
contextually relevant responses tailored to user needs. However, existing RAG
systems have significant limitations, including reliance on flat data
representations and inadequate contextual awareness, which can lead to
fragmented answers that fail to capture complex inter-dependencies. To address
these challenges, we propose LightRAG, which incorporates graph structures into
text indexing and retrieval processes. This innovative framework employs a
dual-level retrieval system that enhances comprehensive information retrieval
from both low-level and high-level knowledge discovery. Additionally, the
integration of graph structures with vector representations facilitates
efficient retrieval of related entities and their relationships, significantly
improving response times while maintaining contextual relevance. This
capability is further enhanced by an incremental update algorithm that ensures
the timely integration of new data, allowing the system to remain effective and
responsive in rapidly changing data environments. Extensive experimental
validation demonstrates considerable improvements in retrieval accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing approaches. We have made our LightRAG
open-source and available at the link: https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and
contextually relevant responses tailored to user needs. However, existing RAG
systems have significant limitations, including reliance on flat data
representations and inadequate contextual awareness, which can lead to
fragmented answers that fail to capture complex inter-dependencies. To address
these challenges, we propose LightRAG, which incorporates graph structures into
text indexing and retrieval processes. This innovative framework employs a
dual-level retrieval system that enhances comprehensive information retrieval
from both low-level and high-level knowledge discovery. Additionally, the
integration of graph structures with vector representations facilitates
efficient retrieval of related entities and their relationships, significantly
improving response times while maintaining contextual relevance. This

the timely integration of new data, allowing the system to remain effective and

framework that enables high-fidelity garment synthesis with precise control
over silhouette, color, and logo placement. Unlike existing methods that are
limited to single-condition inputs, IMAGGarment-1 addresses the challenges of
multi-conditional controllability in personalized fashion design and digital
apparel applications. Specifically, IMAGGarment-1 employs a two-stage training
strategy to separately model global appearance and local details, while
enabling unified and controllable generation through end-to-end inference. In
the first stage, we propose a global appearance model that jointly encodes
silhouette and color using a mixed attention module and a color adapter. In the
second stage, we present a local enhancement model with an adaptive
appearance-aware module to inject user-defined logos and spatial constraints,
enabling accurate placement and visual consistency. To support this task, we
release GarmentBench, a large-scale dataset comprising over 180K garment
samples paired with multi-level design conditions, including sketches, color
references, logo placements, and textual prompts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior
structural stability, color fidelity, and local controllability performance.

at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is

static interaction paradigm, which lacks the ability to see, hear, speak, and
act concurrently as well as handle real-time user interruptions dynamically.
This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and
unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce
VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral
concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a
dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active
Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its
environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute
actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking
capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we
fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level
commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior.
Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E
can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible
with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate
on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing
concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more
natural and capable embodied assistants. Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by a rigid,

featuring a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a
text-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and
linguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora
during a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively
addresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in
conventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve
performance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position
encoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced
post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed
preference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies
alongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations
demonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the
MMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its
capabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models,
including ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also
maintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science
principles, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights
to foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs. We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series

networks recursing at different frequencies. This biologically inspired method
beats Large Language models (LLMs) on hard puzzle tasks such as Sudoku, Maze,
and ARC-AGI while trained with small models (27M parameters) on small data
(around 1000 examples). HRM holds great promise for solving hard problems with
small networks, but it is not yet well understood and may be suboptimal. We
propose Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), a much simpler recursive reasoning approach
that achieves significantly higher generalization than HRM, while using a
single tiny network with only 2 layers. With only 7M parameters, TRM obtains
45% test-accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, higher than most LLMs
(e.g., Deepseek R1, o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with less than 0.01% of the
parameters. Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a novel approach using two small neural
