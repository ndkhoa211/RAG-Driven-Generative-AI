In the recent past, the computer vision community has relied on several centralized benchmarks for performance evaluation of numerous
 tasks including object detection, 
		    pedestrian detection, 3D reconstruction, optical flow, single-object 
		    short-term tracking, and stereo estimation. 


Despite potential pitfalls 
		    of such benchmarks, they have proved to be extremely helpful to advance 
		    the state-of-the-art in the respective research fields. Interestingly, 
		    there has been rather limited work on the standardization of multiple 
		    target tracking evaluation. One of the few exceptions is the well-knownPETSdataset, targeted primarily at 				surveillance applications. Even for 
		    this widely used benchmark, a common technique for presenting tracking 
		    results to date involves using different subsets of the available data, 
		    inconsistent model training and varying evaluation scripts.With this benchmark we would like to pave the way for a 
		    unified framework towards more meaningful quantification of multi-target 
		    tracking. We have created a framework for the fair evaluation of multiple people tracking algorithms. In this framework we provide: We rely on the spirit ofcrowdsourcing, and we encourage researchers to submit their sequences to our benchmark, so the quality of multiple object tracking systems can keep increasing and tackling more challenging scenarios.
